      <dc:description>There is no title attached to this sheet to clarify its provenance and context. It is among other drawings from Aberdeen in the Hutton Collection. It is most probably from St Machar’s Cathedral, as there is a sizeable body of copied inscriptions from the site held in the collection. The watermark in the paper dates it from 1809 onwards. Hutton was intent on collecting as full a record as possible of Scotland’s ecclesiastical monuments. As a result, there are many types of records held in the Hutton Drawings – including plans, elevations, engravings and sketches. There are also pages of handwritten notes. Rubbings come from monuments at other sites, although many of them are largely illegible. It is now difficult to understand their purpose but they were probably for a specific purpose at the time..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a transcript of an inscription from St Machar’s Cathedral, Aberdeen. There is no particular title attached to it but the note along the bottom reveals the sheet’s context. John Forbes of Boynlie made the transcript, and the inscription refers to Henry de Lichton, Bishop of Aberdeen and his nephew Alexander de Rynd of Broxismoche. There is no date attached to this drawing. There are a further twelve drawings of St Machar’s Cathedral included in the Hutton Drawings. St Machar’s Cathedral dates from 1131, and is on a site, which has been in Christian religious use since 580. St Machar was a disciple of Columba, who arrived in Iona during the seventh century, hence the connections between the early site and the dedication of the church. Most of the remains probably date from the fifteenth century onwards, this inscription included..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, of Hume Castle, Berwickshire, would probably have been completed just after preservation work on the structure had been completed in 1789. Hume Castle is the original seat of the Home family, with their lands here being granted to William Hume before 1214. A beacon station against English border raids, the plan of the castle is a simple rectangle courtyard. This is one of the earliest Scottish castle layouts. It also has a motte, or fabricated hill, that it stands on. It was bought over in 1770 by Lord Marchmont, also of the Home family, who then carried out vital preservation work - ensuring its survival to the present day..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving of Dyburgh Abbey, Berwickshire, signed 'Ensign Erskine', was probably by David Stewart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, a friend of George Henry Hutton, and fellow antiquary, who acquired the remains of the abbey in 1786. This is one of four views of Dryburgh Abbey in the Hutton Collection. Hugh de Moreville founded Dryburgh Abbey, near St Boswell’s in Berwickshire, in 1150 for the Premonstratensian Order of White Canons. Much of the abbey complex has been in ruins since the sixteenth century, and the site has a tranquil and deeply romantic atmosphere that Erskine has captured in this engraving. The Abbey held a special place in the heart of Sir Walter Scott and his and his wife's bodies are there..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title attached to this sheet to clarify its provenance and context. The watermark in the paper reads 1809, implying that the rubbing was completed sometime in or after this year. It is amongst other drawings from Aberdeen in the Hutton Collection. It is most probably from St Machar’s Cathedral, as there is a sizeable body of copied inscriptions from the site held in the collection. There are three of these unidentified rubbings in the Hutton Drawings. They all depicted Latin script in this rolling and round style but none of them actually contain a full word. None of the rubbings has any sort of title and they have no obvious link to any other records in the Collection. This is very unusual for this Collection, as Hutton appears to have quite meticulously recorded provenance information about each sheet..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Description of heraldry in Inverkeithing Parish Church, Fife - page 2 of 2. This is the second of a two-page set of notes regarding the armorial font in Inverkeithing Parish Church. There is no date or author's name carried on the first page, and there is none given here. The pages, however, were found between two engravings of the church's armorial font, which were made in 1811. There has been a community of Christian worshippers on this site since the 400s when St Erat and his followers visited this area. The tower and the fine armorial font are now the only remnants of the early stone church built here around 1120. Both of these have been incorporated into the modern buildings. Other ecclesiastical buildings in the near vicinity include the Franciscan house formally established in 1384..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Description of heraldry in Inverkeithing Parish Church, Fife - page 1 of 2. There is no title, heading or dates written on this sheet, suggesting that it is simply personal notes, captured to aid memory recall and not intended for general consumption. This is page one of two, although the second page is a continuation of the first. The notes were found between two sheets that hold engravings of the armorial font in Inverkeithing Parish Church. This suggests that the notes were made around 1811. The most impressive armorial remains to be found in St Peter's Kirk or Inverkeithing Parish Church are those on the font. The font was part of the pre-Reformation church and is one of the oldest remains. It was found in 1806 when other restoration work was being carried out on the church. Armorial information can often help piece historical information together, with its inherent social record of important members of the aristocracy..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This monochrome plan, of Dunfermline Abbey and Monastery, Fife, has no title attached to it. There is an orientation compass carried in the top right corner, a key to the letters down the side of the drawings and a scale opposite it. Alexander Morton completed the plan, and John Fernie had it after 1812. There are eight views of Dunfermline Abbey and Monastery contained in the Hutton Collection, two of which are building plans. The other plan shows how the abbey looked before its tower collapsed in the storms of 1809. Alexander Morton, the draughtsman, completed many of the Fife plans found in the Hutton Collection. Despite this, we know little about the man or his career..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The section of the church appears above the plan with the scale along the bottom. The plans show a standard cruciform church, split into three aisles, the outside two of which have lowered roofs. In 1809, lightning struck the Abbey tower and it collapsed. When the work finished, in 1818, the towers at the west of the church no longer matched - one being square and the other round. The opportunity was there to add a new parish church to the east end of the building. The tomb and body of Robert the Bruce resurfaced during the work..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This untitled drawing, made in 1785 and one of a pair in the Hutton Collection, depicts an ancient standing stone, which stands to the south of Dogton Farm by Kinglassie, in Fife. While this basic sketch does not show it, the stone would originally have been in the shape of a Celtic cross. The name of the artist is not given; it is likely that it was Hutton himself. If the local myths are true, then this sculptured standing stone at Dogton is there to mark the progress made by the marauding Danes during the ninth century. Sadly, this drawing does not do justice to the fine Celtic ornaments that appear on the stone. The stone is nearly 5 feet high, and goes by the name, the 'Dogton Stone'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Andrew Bell made this plan of the St Mary’s Collegiate Church in Crail in 1796. The church's rooms and main areas appear along with their exact measurements, while a scale and compass is included at the foot of the drawing. Although this large aisled church dates from 1243, it did not achieve collegiate status until 1517, when William Myrton was in charge of the architectural alterations that took place that year. Dedicated to the memory of the Irish saint, St Maelrubha, the church received further alterations in later centuries. The south entrance to the church is embellished with a Pictish cross slab, thus highlighting the church's origins..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan of Pittenweem Priory in the East Neuk of Fife was made by Alexander Morton in 1813. The eight numbers included on the plan correspond with the numbered list on the right side of the drawing, and indicate the rooms and main areas of the building. The main door to the priory faces east out on to the Firth of Forth (number eight on the plan), with the top of the drawing being the direction of north. Pittenweem Priory was established in the twelfth century, when the Augustinian monks from the nearby Isle of May decided to construct a new building on the mainland, as it offered better protection from pirates. There is a cave between the priory and the sea, and legend has it that St Fillan, a disciple of St Columba, lived in this cave during the seventh century. The monks cut a staircase from the priory's garden to this cave. As with so many church buildings in Scotland, the priory at Pittenweem suffered extensive damage during the Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton made this plan of St Andrews Cathedral, Fife, in 1813. The plan employs the usual technical drawing conventions. On the right side of the plan is a list of the buildings and important areas that exist within the cathedral's perimeter wall. Roman numerals indicate these buildings and areas on the plan. The origins of the cathedral date back to AD 732, when Bishop Acca supposedly brought the relics (bones) of St Andrew to the settlement. Work started on the cathedral in 1160 and finished in 1318. They consecrated it that same year in the presence of Robert the Bruce. The cathedral did not have good luck, however, and a mixture of stormy weather, invading English armies, the dawning of the Reformation and John Knox’s fiery sermons, combined to leave the long-suffering building in ruins..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title of this watercolour drawing reads, 'Dunfermline Abbey, Fifeshire No 117'. There is no date or artist's name. Drawn from a distance, it shows the abbey towering above surrounding treetops. Queen Margaret - wife of King Malcolm III - founded Dunfermline Abbey around 1070, on the site of a much earlier Celtic church. Established as a Benedictine monastery dedicated to the Holy Trinity, Margaret's son, David I, eventually extended and elevated the Priory to Abbey status in the early-twelfth century. Margaret and Malcolm's bodies lie in the Abbey and, almost 160 years after her death, Margaret became a saint..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This painting, a watercolour of St Andrews Castle, Fife, possibly by Alexander Morton, shows the ruins of the Castle, with the remnants of the west end of the Cathedral and St Regulus' or Rule's Tower in the background. Although no date is included, Morton probably painted it in 1813. St Andrews Castle dates back to the twelfth century, and was the main residence and administrative centre for the bishops and archbishops of St Andrews. As the ruins suggest, the castle has a stormy history and was destroyed and rebuilt on several occasions during the Middle Ages. The castle is strongly associated with Cardinal David Beaton, who met his death, thrown from one of the castle's towers by a group of local landowners, in revenge for the public burning of the Protestant preacher, George Wishart..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Watercolour of the Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews, Fife, numbered 109. This painting shows the Holy Trinity Church, which is located in the centre of St Andrews. The painting is undated. The origins of the Holy Trinity Church go back as far as 1163. The present building dates from 1412. John Knox preached in a fiery manner at this church during the Reformation, and incited a congregational mob to destroy the Cathedral in 1559. The church underwent a major renovation in 1800, which affected its original 1412 design. Another renovation reversed this in 1909..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated plan of Lindores Abbey was made by Alexander Morton, who drew many plans of Scottish church buildings in the early 1800s. A numbered index list appears in the top left corner of the drawing, with the numbers referring to the rooms and areas that form the abbey. The symbol of a compass in the top right of the drawing indicates the direction in which the abbey is facing. Lindores Abbey, located on the southern banks of the River Tay, was founded some time at the end of the twelfth century, by David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I. The first people to inhabit the abbey were Benedictine monks belonging to the Order of Tiron. These monks were led by Abbot Guido, who had previously been the priory at Kelso Abbey. Another victim of the Scottish Reformation, the abbey was finally destroyed by Reformers in 1559..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This coloured plan, of Inchcolm Priory, Inchcolm Island, Firth of Forth, includes a scale and compass, a key to the red lines used on the plan and useful notes regarding the monastery. Along the bottom of the plan, elevations of different parts of the building have been included along with an alphabetical listing that corresponds with the plan. Incholm Priory was founded in the early-twelfth century by King Alexander I, and dedicated to St Columba. Alexander is purported to have sought shelter with a small group of hermits on the island when his boat ran into trouble. In response to their hospitality, he ordered the construction of a priory. Built by Augustinian monks, it was elevated to the status of an abbey in the mid-thirteenth century. After suffering extensive damage during an English invasion in the fourteenth century, the abbey was largely restored during the 1400s..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in 1785 and one of a pair in the Hutton Collection, shows an ancient standing stone, which is located in a field to the south of Dogton Farm by Kinglassie, in Fife. Although this drawing does not show it, the stone would originally have been in the shape of a cross. The artist is not named but was, perhaps, Hutton himself.. According to local legend, the sculptured standing stone at Dogton marks the inroads made by the invading Danes during the ninth century. Although this Celtic stone is highly ornamental, this drawing does not show up the many the symbols and decorations that appear on it..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This image shows plan and side elevation technical drawings of St Salvator's Chapel in St Andrews, and the church of St Monans. A list of the areas of each church appears in a content section in the middle of the drawing, with accompanying numbers for identification purposes. Alexander Morton made this drawing around 1813. Also known as the Old College, St Salvator's Chapel and Tower lies at the heart of the medieval St Andrews, and was founded in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy as the College of the Holy Saviour. Protestant reformers damaged it during the Reformation, and it was rebuilt from 1680 onwards. St Monans Church dates back to the thirteenth century. King David II ordered the church built, after surviving a terrible storm in the River Forth. English soldiers burnt it down in 1544, but the town rebuilt it in 1646. Unusually, an eighteenth century ship hangs from the church's ceiling..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, shows the exterior of the Abbey in some detail. It is one of several in the Hutton Collection. It is undated and unsigned. Although there is no date attached to this drawing, it most likely dates from the late-eighteenth or early-nineteenth century. As considerable work was undertaken between 1818 and 1821, with the construction of the new abbey church to replace the ruined east-end of the old church, this drawing offers a view of the abbey before these dramatic changes were undertaken..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There are no details attached to drawing of Dunfermline Abbey, although it is one of eight views of the Abbey and its ruined monastery. This, the east end, now houses Dunfermline Parish Church and is a flourishing community focal point. A member of the Scottish Culdee Church married Malcolm Canmore and Margaret Aethling in Dunfermline in about 1070. It was about two years after this that Queen Margaret, of Anglo-Saxon descent and of Roman-Catholic persuasion, invited the Benedictine Order to establish a house there. This also led to the demise of the Celtic-Culdee faith in the area. The original church and monastery were smaller and of wattle and daub..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title or date attached to this drawing of a tombstone, but it probably dates from 1814. There are four other images of Inverkeithing Parish Church or St Peter's Kirk in the Hutton Collection. None of them portrays the outside of the building, which would have been relatively modern, highlighting the important features of the site. There are many images of carved gravestones and markers amongst the Hutton Collection and their origins spread across Scotland. This unique and accessible record then makes it easy to trace and research the development of monument symbolism, fashion and importance. They range from flat slabs in the tenth century, to ornate niches in the seventeenth and then this simple upright cross in the eighteenth..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton made this drawing of Balmerino Abbey in 1813. It complements a plan drawing that Morton made of the abbey that same year. The Abbey stands on the south bank of the River Tay, near Newport-on-Tay. Lady Ermengarde, the second wife and widowed queen of William the Lyon, founded Balmerino Abbey in 1229. It was set up for an order of Cistercian monks. The Reformation destroyed the Abbey. The abbey boasts magnificent views over and along the River Tay, while a Spanish Chestnut tree in the abbey's grounds is one of the oldest of its type in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Made in July 1790, this fine drawing, based on a sketch made by Thomas Cocking, shows the ruined walls of Lindores Abbey. A note in the bottom left corner of the page attributes the original source for the drawing. The name of the artist is not included. Situated on the southern banks of the River Tay, Lindores Abbey was founded by David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I, near the end of the twelfth century. Benedictine monks from the Order of Tiron were the first cleric to inhabit the abbey. Abbot Lawrence, a noted theologian and one of the founders of St Andrews University, was probably the most famous leader of the abbey. As with so many church buildings in Scotland, the abbey was destroyed by mobs during the Reformation period..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the Kinross shoreline of Loch Leven in Fife, with the outline of Loch Leven Castle just visible on the very far left of the picture. The name of the island in the distance is Castle Island. Dating back to the thirteenth century, this castle is most famous for being the place where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in June 1567. The Castle was gifted to the Douglas family by King Robert II in 1372. Sir William Douglas was Mary's gaoler during her imprisonment, although his younger son, Willie Douglas, helped Mary to escape in 1568, principally because he was besotted with the young queen. The Castle was bought from the impoverished Douglas family by Sir William Bruce in 1764. Since the eighteenth century, it has been a ruin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the ruins of Loch Leven Castle in Fife. It is now known who made this drawing. The castle is located on Castle Island, which is located on the western edge of the loch, near the town of Kinross. Loch Leven Castle was probably built sometime in the thirteenth century. The castle is strongly associated with the Douglas family, who received it as a gift from King Robert II of Scotland in 1372. Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned there in 1567 during the Reformation period, although she escaped the following year with the help of her gaoler's son, Willie Douglas.

      <dc:description>This drawing of Loch Leven Castle was made by Miss Alicia Jones (later Mrs Duke Crofton of Lakefield, Co. Leitrim, Ireland) in 1807. A note at the foot of the drawing states the artist's name and that she was from 'Belleville near Athlone'. Loch Leven Castle is probably most famous as being the location where Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned in June 1567, during the Scottish Reformation. Dating back to the thirteenth century, King Robert II of Scotland granted the castle to the Douglas family in 1372. Indeed, Willie Douglas helped the young queen escape in 1568, even though his father was Mary's gaoler. Sir William Bruce purchased the castle from the impoverished Douglas family in 1764..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing and description of Muness Castle, Shetland. The information under the title goes on to compare this castle to Scalloway Castle, also on Shetland and gives a brief description of the building. The original was completed by Edward H. Columbine in 1792 and this copy was made for Hutton in 1802. Edward Columbine is known to have worked for the Office of the Admiralty, mainly as a hydrographer and captain. The records of his career, however, are patchy. He made three drawings on Shetland in 1792 and left descriptions with them, implying he had some time to spend at the sites. These sheets then, although recording important monuments themselves, also help to fill the gaps in his career! The note correcting the name to 'Buness' is incorrect..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is an orientation arrow in the top left corner of this chart, while the right-hand side of the sheet carries an explanation of the shorthand used. It was drawn up in 1780 and delineates areas belonging to the Burgh. Places of local and Christian importance have also been plotted. The Christian site at Whithorn was founded in 397 by St Ninian and was the first Christian settlement to be built north of Hadrian’s wall. The name is thought to derive from the Pictish translation of ‘white house’ or ‘Hwit Aerne’. Ninian’s church was painted white and so earned the Latin name ‘Candida Casa’ or ‘white house’. Ninian originally from Galloway is known to have visited Rome and is thought to have been close friends with St Martin of Tours. Whithorn is one of the most important early-European Christian sites..</dc:description>

Dyed at Striviling 1214 &amp; was buried at Aberbrothick." A note at the bottom of this portrait of William I reads, 'From the original (in the Trinity Hall, Aberdeen) by R. Munro (artist, Aberdeen, July 1821)'. The King is an older man in this picture. A letter from Hutton to John Dillon, who was the secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, accompanies this Munro painting: it would appear there was some doubt over the authenticity of the original. This has still not been resolved and is the subject of continuing debate..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch was created in 1811, although there is no artist’s name attached to the piece. The fragment is part of a tombstone, dating from 1478, which marked the grave of a deceased Dominican friar. There are many images depicting Scottish gravemarkers held in the Hutton Drawings. They were collected from all over Scotland and cover a very wide time period. Together they form a comprehensive record of Scottish burial traditions and fashions. This tombstone is interesting because it holds its information in Latin script rather than pictorial symbols..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title attached to this sheet to clarify its provenance and context. The watermark in the paper reads 1809, implying that the rubbing was completed sometime in or after this year. It can be found amongst other drawings from Aberdeen and is most probably taken from St Machar’s Cathedral as there are fifteen views of the complex, some of which are transcriptions and inscriptions. This rubbing is only one of many held across the whole of the Hutton Drawings. Like the others, it does not contain a complete word suggesting that it was created for analysis of the lettering and carving style..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The dedication on this print explains that it is a drawing of a military encampment, by James Wales, and dedicated to the Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. It is dated 1782 and is thought to be an incomplete picture. It has been suggested as a result that it is a proof run of the eventual final print. No further information is given either on the sheet or in the Hutton Drawings to explain its purpose in the collection or how it found a home there. The Dukes of Buccleuch and their families were always a formidable political force in Scotland’s power machinations but they are perhaps better remembered as military leaders and organisers. The Duke’s regularly issued broadsides in and around the Edinburgh area, especially, advertising the King’s coin, and the adventures which could be found as a regular soldier..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There are many fragments of transcriptions or rubbings held amongst the Hutton Drawings. Most of them, however, at least have their original location recorded with them. This example has no provenance attached to it and it is not clear from its location in the collection. On the other hand it is the most complete transcription held in the Drawings. St Christopher is thought to have been a been a Roman soldier who was martyred for his faith sometime in the third century in Syria. Despite these relatively humble origins the mediaeval West built up a fantastical myth. The legendary giant, Christopher, is thought to have carried Christ on his shoulder across the river – a totally unsubstantiated fabrication. Nevertheless the story has a popular moral appeal and has, and still does, enjoy great popularity..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The note along the bottom of this sketch reads, ‘Copy of sketch of crowned head on back of a charter, 1322, in College of Glasgow’. There are no artist’s names attached or copy dates, just the original. This sketch is to be found with other ‘miscellaneous’ drawings at the end of the Hutton Drawings and as such no further information about the sheet can be guessed at. Robert the Bruce was King of Scotland at this time, reigning from 1306 to 1329. However, from the style of the crown, it is more likely that this drawing, or doodle, is meant to represent Edward II, King of England from 1307 to 1327. (1322 was the date of Edward's last invasion of Scotland.) There are many representations of mediaeval art and stylised figures to be found in the Hutton Drawings and this is one of the helpful aspects of the collection. The lack of context to this drawing makes it difficult to interpret and therefore more difficult for researchers to use..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the ruins of the priory on St Serf's Island in Loch Leven, Fife. A note below the drawing reads, 'The roof fell 1788'. Loch Leven Castle is located on Castle Island, north-east of St Serf's Island. Although St Serfs Island, also known as the Inch, was inhabited by Culdee monks as long as 800 years ago, the ninth century priory was built by monks from St Andrews. Up until the Reformation, the priory was occupied by priors of the Augustinian Order, who had quite a reputation for their literary output. The 'Oryginale Cronykil of Scotland', written by Prior Andrew Wyntoun at the beginning of the fifteenth century, is one such example of the order's erudite endeavours. A ruined chapel is the only remainder of the priory, while the island now forms part of the Loch Leven Nature Reserve..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows the castle at Loch Orr, which is nowadays known as Lochore or Loch Ore Castle. A note at the foot of the drawing reads, 'Castle of Loch Orr, Fifeshire 1781'. This drawing was reproduced in France Grose's book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1791. The name of the artist is not given, but it is likely that it was Hutton himself. Also known as, Inchgall Castle, Lochore Castle was built during the 1400s, and located near Ballingry in Fife. The castle is famously associated with the Wardlaw family, who gained control of the building following the marriage of Andrew Wardlaw of Torry sometime during the fifteenth century. Lochore Castle remained a possession of the Wardlaw family until the beginning of the seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in July 1784, shows part of the ruins of Lindores Abbey. The drawing's title, included at the bottom of the page, reads, 'Part of Lindores Abbey 1784'. The name of the artist has not been included, although it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. David, Earl of Huntingdon established Lindores Abbey in 1191. It is located by the town of Newburgh, on the northern banks of the River Tay. A Tironesian Abbey inhabited by Benedictine monks, it was dedicated to St Mary, St Andrew and All Saints. As with so many church buildings, Lindores Abbey was destroyed by Reformers during the Scottish Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of the priory at Pittenweem was made in 1783, and appeared in volume I of Captain Francis Grose's book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791. The artist, probably Hutton himself, was looking at the ruins of the priory from the north, with the River Forth - complete with ships -shown in the left side of the drawing. The Priory is located in the East Neuk of Fife, at the mouth of the River Forth. Pittenweem Priory has its origins in the ancient religious settlements that previously existed on the nearby Isle of May. In their desire to find a safer location for their community, the Augustinian monks from the island decided to construct a new building on the mainland, sometime during the twelfth century. The famous cave that lies among the cliffs below the priory is rumoured to have been the home of St Fillan, who was a disciple of St Columba. The Priory suffered extensive damage during the Reformation period..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title and note along the bottom of this drawing reads, 'Roch Abbey in Yorkshire etched by Barrett'. This drawing is unique in the Hutton collection as it is depicting a building in England. There is no further information about the artist. It is difficult to say which part of the Abbey the drawing is depicting. It does not seem to be the church as the transepts of the church remain almost to their full height although many of the other buildings now survive only as low standing walls. Set in the deep enchanting valley and contained within the natural boundaries of magnesium limestone cliffs, Roch Abbey is a magnificent example of the French-influenced early Gothic architecture. The Abbey was founded in 1147 and it is known that there were 14 monks and 4 novices at the monastery at the time of the Dissolution in 1538 after which the buildings were plundered by local people..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows Rosyth Castle in Fife, which is located in the town's navy dockyards by the River Forth. The anonymous drawing of the castle was made in 1784, and appeared in volume I of Captain Francis Grose's book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791. Rosyth Castle was built sometime during the thirteenth century, and is closely associated with two of Scotland's most famous families, the Stewarts and the Wardlaws. As the drawing's title indicates, Rosyth Castle is most famous as being the birthplace of Elizabeth Cromwell, the mother of Oliver, in or around 1564..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This picture is one of two views of the ruins, of Inchcolm Abbey, on the island. The other one is dated 1784 but there is no artist attached to either. The building at the front centre of the image houses the dormitories on the second floor and storage rooms underneath. The cloisters were directly behind this building. Alexander I invited the Augustinian canons onto the island in 1123, when the hermits sheltered him there after a shipwreck. The island, however, has a much older ecclesiastical history, and is known as the Iona of the east. As the island's name implies it has associations with St Columba. In the intervening years, many members of Danish descent were buried here..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing reads, ‘From a sketch made by Captain Columbine 1792’. This copy is thought to have been made in 1802, at Hutton’s request. It is one of two records of Scalloway, the other being a written description left by Columbine. The Castle was built in 1600 by Patrick Stewart, who was the grandson of James V. His father, Robert Stewart was the natural son of James, who granted his illegitimate son the earldom of Orkney along with lands on Shetland. Unlike many of the buildings on Shetland which tended to reflect the very mixed cultural inheritance of the island, this building is a traditional lowland ‘z’ shaped tower house..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated drawing shows the late Gothic architecture of St Salvator's Chapel and Tower (also known as the Old College), in the centre of St Andrews. The drawing is from a sketch by the Rev J. Cordiner'. The St Salvator quadrangle is located immediately beside the Old College. Founded in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy as the College of the Holy Saviour, St Salvator's Chapel and Tower is the medieval lynchpin of St Andrews. Protestant reformers damaged the Chapel during the Reformation, and it underwent a major rebuilding programme from 1680 onwards. The quadrangle area beside St Salvator's is highly popular with the university's students..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in July 1790, depicts the ruins of Lindores Abbey. A note at the bottom of the page reads, 'Lindores Abbey Perthshire July 17 - 1790'. It is not known who made this drawing. Although the artist writes that the location is 'Perthshire', Newburgh is now regarded as part of Fife. Located near Newburgh on the southern banks of the River Tay, Lindores Abbey was established in 1191 by David, Earl of Huntingdon. It was a Tironesian Abbey, and was dedicated to St Mary, St Andrew and All Saints. During the Scottish Reformation, it was attacked by mobs in 1543 and 1559, which destroyed it. Only a few fragments of the church and the bell-tower now remain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch is associated with Captain Francis Grose's 'Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1791. Barrel vaulting was a fabulous medieval discovery. Improved weight distribution and wider vault spaces resulted in changes in architecture and lifestyles. David I, King of Scotland, as a tribute to his mother's piety, personality and achievements decided to replace Margaret's tiny original chapel with a grand new church, and in 1150, he granted the Priory abbey status. Margaret, the founder and patron of Dunfermline Abbey, was canonised in 1250 and her relics moved to a new shrine in 1259. This event not only involved further new building projects at the abbey but also increased the site's prestige as a pilgrimage centre..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of the monastery ruins, Dunfermline Abbey, Fife. There are no dates or artists attached to this sheet. This image shows the south wall of the Benedictine monastery, the room behind which was the refectory. English troops sacked the Abbey during the War of Independence in 1303. Robert the Bruce rebuilt it once peace came. These buildings all date from this time. Post-Reformation, the abbey and its possessions became the property of the Crown, the process taking until 1593. This area in particular became the Royal Palace..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This damaged drawing shows the ruins of Balmerino Abbey, which is located on the south bank of the River Tay, opposite the western edge of Dundee. The drawing is entitled 'Part of Balmerino [missing text]', and dates from around 1781. It is one of several drawings of the Abbey in the Hutton Collection. This drawing appeared in volume I of Captain Francis Grose's book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791. The human figures included in this drawing provide the viewer with a sense of proportion regarding the ruined abbey's size. Lady Ermengarde, the widow of William the Lyon, founded Balmerino Abbey in 1229 for a group of Cistercian monks. The Abbey was dedicated to the memory of the Blessed Virgin and Lady Ermengarde's relative, King Edward the Confessor. The Abbey was a victim of the widespread destruction of Scottish churches that took place during the Reformation period..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of the ruins of Inchcolm Abbey on Inchcolm Island in the Firth of Forth. Much of what you see is still extant today. The buildings immediately visible in the centre of the image are the ruins of the sacristy and directly behind it to the left is the still-complete chapter house. The ruins at Inchcolm are the best-preserved medieval male monastic ruins in Britain. David I founded the buildings on Inchcolm, many of which, the tower included, are still intact, in 1223. One of David's policies was to regularise and officially endorse many of Scotland's ecclesiastical establishments, and he was heavily involved in issuing foundation charters. Despite this, the community of Augustinian canons had been living on the island since their invitation in 1123 by Alexander I..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving is by E. Mitchell from a drawing by W. Paterson, and is one of two such engravings in the Hutton Collection. Mounted on a decorative pedestal, the font includes stone carvings of several coats of arms held in place by angels. There is no date attached. In this instance, the church being referred to is probably St Peter's Kirk, which dates from the early-twelfth century and is located on Church Street in the centre of Inverkeithing. The armorial font, seen here, and the church tower are all that remain of the original pre-Reformation parish church. According to Groome (1894), the sculpted font was one of the finest in Scotland. He also noted that it was 'disinterred from the rubbish in 1806 in making foundations for repairs on the church'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There are no details attached to this engraving of Culross Abbey and town, Fife. The Abbey tower dominates the skyline and the whole building stands at the top of the hill overlooking the town. Culross was founded as a Cistercian house in 1218, by Malcolm the Earl of Fife. Although once very prosperous it had fallen into decay by the time, the east choir was restructured to house the parish church. The town itself enjoyed a flourishing economy based on trade, coal and salt panning. This too, however, was on the wan by the middle of the nineteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There are no details given on this engraving of Culross Abbey, Fife. The drawing was completed standing in the north, looking to the north-east, which is a relatively unusual view. There are a further two images of Culross in amongst the Hutton Collection which together give a rounded impression of the abbey and town. Culross Abbey was founded in 1218 by Malcolm, 7th Earl of Fife. It established itself as a small Cistercian monastery, which is probably best-remembered as the birthplace and school of St Kentigern. The area also has associations with St Serf. At its height, the abbey had a first class reputation for its scriptorium and the binding and illuminations it produced, as well as for its gardens..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This only one page from a series, which together would have constituted a letter between Edward H. Columbine and Hutton. The other pages are now, unfortunately missing. The original description was thought to have been written in 1792 and this copy was made in 1802. Here Columbine talks about the style and condition of houses on Shetland in general and then goes on to talk about the castle specifically. Columbine was not known for his written descriptions and so this page is relatively unusual. Columbine mainly worked for the Office of the Admiralty as a hydrographer and a substantial amount of his work was completed around the coast of Scotland. Virtually simultaneously he was producing sketches of interesting monuments and the profiles of interesting pieces of coastline. Hutton then had substantial amounts of his worked copied so that he could add it to his collection..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a panoramic view of St Andrews, Fife, 'from an etching by Mr Clark'. You can see both the distinctive church spires and its exposed position. The French frigate the Belle Isle was on a mission round the British coast. Francois Thurot of Boulogne engineered and commanded the expedition. The ship was to harass the British coastline, this act being an initiation of war. This incident was a relatively minor affair compared to the havoc that Thurot wreaked on the Western Isles, Ireland and the Isle of Man, later in 1759..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a plan and elevation of ancient ecclesiastical buildings on the Isle of May, Firth of Forth, made by Robert Stevenson in or around 1818. The top part of the page contains the elevation drawing, while the lower part contains the plan of the building. Robert Stevenson was a relative of the writer, Robert Louis Stevenson. The Isle of May is located at the entrance to the River Forth, just off the East Neuk coast of Fife. One of Scotland's most important archaeological sites, excavations suggest that there was a Christian community on the Isle of May as early as the seventh century. Certainly, it is known that a Benedictine church existed on the island from 1145 onwards. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, this church was a popular place with pilgrims. It is likely that the first religious settlers on the island were Irish and Pictish clerics who had trained at Iona, and who were chosen to visit the Fife area to convert the people there to Christianity..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Balmerino Abbey, Fife made by Alexander Morton in 1813. A numbered list of the abbey's rooms and areas is included on the right side of the drawing, together with a compass. The artist's signature is included at the foot of the drawing. Balmerino Abbey is located on the south bank of the River Tay, opposite the city of Dundee. Founded in 1229 by Lady Ermengarde, second wife and widow of William the Lyon, Balmerino Abbey is a Cistercian Abbey. Sadly, as with so many of Scotland's church buildings, the Reformation destroyed Balmerino Abbey. Mary, Queen of Scots visited the abbey in 1565 during the Reformation era, probably staying in the Abbot's House as a guest of Sir John Hay, the first Lay Commendator of the abbey..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This rough sketch shows the exterior of Dunfermline Abbey viewed from the side. Another drawing in the Hutton Collection shows the abbey from the same angle in much more detail. It is possible they are both by the same artist and that this example was merely a preliminary sketch. There is no date or artist's name. Founded around 1070 by Queen Margaret as a house for Benedictine monks, and elevated to the status of an abbey by her son David I in the early-twelfth century, Dunfermline Abbey soon became an important ecclesiastical centre and burial place for Scottish monarchs. Queen Margaret and her husband, King Malcolm III, were both buried in the abbey, as was their son, King David I, and perhaps most famously, the abbey was the final resting place for Robert the Bruce..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Copy of an engraving of a north view of Jedburgh Abbey, Roxburghshire. It appears to be entitled 'Jeddsworth from the North'. It is undoubtedly a view of Jedburgh Abbey, and it is unclear whether the misspelled name was George Henry Hutton's mistake, or whether the original engraving was given this title. The engraving was made by R. Godfrey and appeared in 'The Antiquarian Repertory, volume IV', by Francis Grose, in 1776. This copy, which was probably made by Hutton himself, is one of six views of Jedburgh Abbey in the Hutton Collection. Jedburgh Abbey was founded as a priory by King David I in 1138, but in 1147 was raised to abbey status and populated by a community of Augustinian or 'black' canons. It is thought that the abbey church, built to a grand Romanseque design, took the better part of a century to complete. Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries the abbey was the subject of many attacks by English troops, and after the Reformation in 1560 its dwindling community of canons died out. The abbey, however, continued in use as Jedburgh's parish church until 1875, which perhaps explains how so much of the building has remained intact compared to the other great Scottish border abbeys..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This ground plan of Dornoch Cathedral was drawn up by James Shand in 1815. There is a scale and orientation compass in the top left corner of the sheet. The rest of the sheet is covered in notes made by Shand. These clarify some of the architectural details and the history of the building. Dornoch is best known in its capacity as the mediaeval administration centre of the area of Sutherland. Its prestige and power was further reinforced by the towns ecclesiastical role, the Cathedral functioning as the area’s spiritual focus. The town and its surrounding shoreline is better known today for its romantic highland atmosphere and the relaxing leisure activities it has to offer..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of a cruciform monument, Applecross, Ross-shire. It shows a large stone slab carved with a Celtic cross. The only information provided on the sheet is the location, 'at Applecross', and various measurements. The artist's name and the date have not been included. The village of Applecross lies on a peninsula between Loch Torridon and Loch Kishorn, in Ross-shire. Until the 1970s, the only overland route into Applecross was across the 'Bealach na Ba' or 'The Pass of the Cattle'. Originally, an old drove road, it rises from sea level to just over 2,000 feet in around 5 miles and is one of the highest roads in Scotland. Despite its isolation from the rest of the country for so many centuries, Applecross was home to one of the earliest Christian settlements in Scotland; in the seventh century an Irish monk by the name of Maelrubha founded a monastery here. Although little remains of the early settlement, a few ancient relics still lie near the local church, including the Celtic cross-slab in the churchyard..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of St Duthac's Collegiate Church, Tain, Ross-shire. It was surveyed and drawn by James Shand in 1819, and shows the interior of St Duthac's Collegiate Church, Tain. Shand has included measurements and a scale, and has also provided an alphabetical list of 'Remarks' that correspond with the letters on the plan. St Duthac's Collegiate Church was built between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries on the site of a much earlier church, part of which still remains in the churchyard today. It replaced St Duthac's Chapel as a place of pilgrimage and sanctuary after the chapel was destroyed by fire in 1427. After the fire, St Duthac's remains were transferred from the ruined chapel to the collegiate church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketched ground-plan of St Mary's Chapel, Shiant Islands, Ross-shire. It is dated July 6th 1818, and was made by William Daniell, who was responsible for several works in the Hutton Collection, including a drawing of St Mary's Chapel showing its spectucular geographical setting. That drawing, and this plan, are the only two images relating to the Shiant Islands in the Hutton Collection. Hutton's plan shows that the ruined Chapel of St Mary was built to a very simple, rectangular plan. The age of the chapel is unknown, but it is believed that a priest sought sanctuary here during the period around the Reformation in 1560. The chapel sits on Eilean Mhuire, or Mary's Island, one of three habitable islands in the Shiant archipelago, which lies south-east of the Isle of Lewis. Only one of the islands, Eilean an Tighe, remains inhabited today..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page is signed by James Shand. It contains what appear to be sketches of two views of St Duthac's Collegiate Church, Tain, Ross-shire: one an end elevation and the other an incomplete side elevation. The sketches were jotted down on the back of a printed form, and it is possible that they were merely preliminary sketches for more formal drawings made later by Shand. The Hutton Collection contains several more detailed and formal views of St Duthac's Collegiate Church by Shand. St Duthac's Collegiate Church sits on Castle Brae in the centre of Tain, on the coast of the Dornoch Firth. The building dates from 1360, although the church did not become collegiate until 1487. Unlike many collegiate or monastic institutions, St Duthac's did not suffer significant damage during the Reformation, and although some of its interior ornamentation is thought to have been stripped, a statue of St Duthac on the outside of the west wall survived. At the time these sketches were made, the church was beginning to fall into disrepair, but it was restored and re-roofed in 1877..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated ground-plan of Fearn Abbey is one of three ground-plans of this building in the Hutton Collection, and one of at least nine items relating to Fearn. The other two ground-plans in the collection are attributed to a draughtsman named James Shand, but this rougher plan does not carry the artist's name, and may have been sketched by Hutton himself. The details marked on this plan are mainly restricted to the locations of doors and windows in Fearn Abbey. Due to the lack of explanatory notes, it is difficult to know whether this is meant to represent a ground-plan of the abbey as it once might have been, or whether it is a ground plan of the building as it existed in Hutton's lifetime. The architectural history of the site has been eventful, and the abbey is known to have been rebuilt in the fourteenth and again in the eighteenth centuries, and to have undergone further restoration after the second rebuilding..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This rough sketch shows an arch that once formed part of a funerary monument in Fearn Abbey. The artist, possibly Hutton himself, has included a note: 'Arch in the Ruins of the abbey of Fearn, under which the Effigies of Ferquhard, Earl of Ross, the Founder, is said to have laid. The figure greatly mutilated [?], now lies in the church Yard over one of the Graves'. Ferquhard, Earl of Ross is said to have founded the abbey in the thirteenth century. Originally located at Edderton, the abbey was moved to its present location soon after and was rebuilt in the fourteenth century under the instructions of William, Earl of Ross. This sketch appears to illustrate all that remains of Ferquhard's tomb. It was not unusual for graveslabs to be removed from their original location, as the earl's obviously was, and placed over modern graves..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows the south view of Jedburgh Abbey. The artist has chosen to sketch it from a considerable distance and has included much of the surrounding countryside. Jedburgh Abbey is situated on the north bank of the Jed Water, Jedburgh. It was established, initially as a priory, in the early-twelfth century by King David I. Due to the abbey's close proximity to the English border, it was the scene of much fighting between the Scots and the English and suffered repeated attacks throughout the centuries..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, possibly of Fearn Abbey, Ross-shire, is not dated and is unsigned by the artist but may be one of Hutton's own works. There are at least nine items relating to Fearn Abbey in the Hutton Collection, but it is not entirely clear whether this sketch refers to the same site. The title 'Fearn Island Priory' under this sketch introduces an element of doubt about what the sketch is supposed to represent. Fearn Abbey is not on an island, but it is in the eastern peninsula of Ross-shire erroneously known as the Black Isle. Moreover, the religious foundation at Fearn seems to have been an abbey from its beginnings, rather than having been promoted from priory status. It may be that the artist, whether Hutton or not, made this sketch while still unsure of the history and exact geography of the site. However, the sketch is too incomplete to be conclusively recognisable as Fearn Abbey, and the possibility remains that it may be of a completely different site, and that there may be some error in the location ascribed to it..</dc:description>

The print was produced for and sold by Robert Jameson of Parliament Square, Edinburgh, and is one of three by Rutherford in the Hutton Collection. Rutherford was responsible for another print of Jedburgh Abbey viewed from the north-east. It is also contained in the Hutton Collection and shows a very similar scene to this one, and is dated 1775. Initially a priory, Jedburgh Abbey was founded in the early-twelfth century by King David I and for many years was home to canons of the Augustinian Order..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This view shows is of the south wall of the church and the adjacent houses. It is though to have been drawn in 1811 but there is no artist’s name attached. Portpatrick lies opposite Donaghdee in Ireland, which is only 2 miles away and the gulf stream from the Irish Channel results in the areas mild climate. The town itself lies at the bottom of a cleft in the hills and provides easy access to Stranraer and Galloway. These factors meant that Portpatrick enjoyed a busy harbour industry, with fishing, freight, mail packets, coastguards and lifeboats all operating from its shore. It also provided an enjoyable holiday resort for Victorians to relax in during their leisure time..</dc:description>

There are a number of other drawings in the Hutton Collection that detail Fearn Abbey. Fearn Abbey is thought to have been founded in the thirteenth century by Ferquhard, Earl of Ross. It was home to monks of the Premonstratensian Order, who divided their time between prayer and working the surrounding land. The monks occupied the abbey until the Reformation (1560), after which it was used as the local parish church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The note on this drawing reveals that it was drawn in 1813 by Alexander Morton. A key to his annotations has been included down the right of the sheet and he has written a further note on the condition of the remains at the time, underneath this. There are three views of the nunnery contained in the Hutton Drawings, and they all focus on the architectural detail of the remains. Alexander Morton was a prolific draughtsman, according to the volume of plans contained in the Hutton Drawings. Hutton was interested in recording all aspects of ecclesiastical buildings and plans and elevations are interesting and useful tools, which help form a complete record of a site. It is also known that Hutton often contracted the record making process out. It is thought that Morton was a builder, based in Dunfermline, and so this would have made him an ideal candidate to make schematic drawings of sites in south-east Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>It is likely that Hutton himself made this copy of the plan from the original by the celebrated architect Edward Blore (1790-1879). It shows an overhead plan of the main abbey building. Melrose Abbey was founded in 1136. It was almost destroyed in the Scottish Wars of Independence, but was rebuilt between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is these more elegant and intricate remains which are visible today. Robert the Bruce's heart is buried within the abbey, as are the remains of many of the powerful Border family, the Douglases..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no information attached to this rubbing at all. It is to be found amongst five other views of Whithorn Priory, most were created in 1811. Hutton seems to have collected many of these miscellaneous rubbings of parts of carved stones. The Hutton Drawings contain many representations of stone carvings from all over Scotland and covering many time periods. Together they form a fascinating record of decorative Scottish stone monuments. There were many fine carved stones found at Whithorn, including the Latinus stone, the earliest Christian monument in Scotland and the Monreith Cross, embodying the finest elements of the Whithorn school of carving..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Annotated ground-plan of Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. It is dated 1815, and was drawn by John Macqueen. Maqueen's extensively annotated plan occupies two pages, both held in the Hutton Collection. This page contains the ground-plans of the different parts of the cathedral complex, some physical description, and the beginning of a list of references to parts of the building, denoted by different numbers and letters on the ground-plans. The second page continues the list of references, and describes the dimensions and proportions of various aspects of the buildings. This is one of at least nine images relating to Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. Like several other of the images, however, the page's title refers to the cathedral as 'The Cathedral Church of Ross'. This is because when the cathedral was built by Bishop Robert of Ross about 1214, Fortrose became the 'see' or centre of the Roman Catholic diocese of Ross, and the cathedral represented a focal point for the religious life of the whole county, rather than just the village of Fortrose..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of a north view of Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. It is dated October 1815, and, as not attributed to any particular artist, may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This is one of nine views of Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. Fortrose Cathedral is situated in the centre of the village of Fortrose, on the south-east coast of the Black Isle north of Inverness. The Cathedral was built some time between 1214 and 1249 by Robert, Bishop of Ross, and thereafter Fortrose became the 'see', or centre, of the Roman Catholic diocese of Ross-shire..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of a north view of Littledean Tower, Roxburghshire. It shows the ruins of Littledean Tower in its wooded, elevated situation above the River Tweed. The drawing, which is unsigned by the artist, is the only image relating to this site in the Hutton Collection. Littledean Tower was built in the late-fifteenth century as the family home of the Kers of Littledean, who were a branch of the Kers of Cessford, a prominent Borders family. Various legends and supernatural stories have become attached to the tower, the most famous of which is that of the Old Lady of Littledean. This was a former mistress of the tower whose spirit could not rest because of her guilt over the covetous and greedy life she had led, and haunted the tower..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of a north-east view of Kelso Abbey, dated 1788. It is one of five items relating to Kelso in the Hutton Collection, and was reproduced in Francis Grose's book 'The Antiquities of Scotland, volume I', which was published in London in 1789. As the page does not carry the signature of the artist, it is not clear whether Grose made the drawing himself, or whether it is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. Very little of Kelso Abbey now remains - the east end of the nave, shown here in Hutton's drawing, is the only substantial part of the building to have survived a raid by English troops in 1550, the Reformation ten years later, and the likely subsequent pillaging of the site for building stone. However, it is thought that at its height, Kelso Abbey was one of the most spectacular and ambitious buildings ever to have stood in Scotland. The Romanesque-style abbey, founded by King David I in 1128, is believed to have been double-cruciform in its layout, having four transepts instead of two, and two towers instead of one..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no artist’s name attached to this sketch although the date 1811 has been noted along the edge of it. The location of this feature within the castle is also unclear. This is one of two images of features from the Rhinns of Galloway area. Dunskey Castle was built in 1510 by the Adairs of Kilhilt and is protected on three sides by rock face and on the fourth by a 15 metre rock-cut ditch crossed by a draw bridge. The buildings themselves would have formed a fashionable renaissance internal coutryard but many of the individual buildings are now largely indistinguishable. This structure replaced an earlier L-shaped tower house which was burnt down during a siege in 1489..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated October 9th 1815 and, as not attributed to any artist, is likely to have been drawn by Hutton himself. This is one of several drawings made at Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. The font is the octagonal basin in the left foreground of the picture. A window in the eastern wall occupies the centre-ground, and there are what appear to be a number of gravestones against the wall. The font in a church or chapel contains the holy water in which infants and church members are baptised. The font is usually found near to the altar, which is traditionally in the east end of a church building. This tradition derives from Mosaic Law (the instructions that the Old Testament describes being given by God to Moses), which dictated that the apostles should pray facing the east..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing appears to be a funerary monument in Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. It consists of a stone effigy of a human figure lying on a plinth, underneath an ornamented arch. There are short descriptive notes on either side of the arch, but there are no notes to indicate the date of the drawing or the identity of the artist. This is one of at least nine items relating to Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. The ruins of Fortrose Cathedral contain three arched tombs. One commemorates the Countess of Ross-shire, who was the wife of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, better known as the 'Wolf of Badenoch'. The other two tombs mark the graves of Bishop Fraser, who died in 1507, and Bishop Cairncross, who died in 1545. The notes on the page do not indicate which of these tombs is reproduced in the drawing..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is one of a number of images relating to Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection, and the majority of them are dated 1815. Although this drawing is not attributed to any particular artist, it is likely that this was one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This view of Fortrose Cathedral shows that it was in roughly the same state of repair, or disrepair, as it is today. Most of what remains of the cathedral dates from the fourteenth century, but the foundations are of the original thirteenth century building, which was established by Robert, Bishop of Ross, some time between 1214 and 1249. The cathedral made Fortrose the 'see', or centre, of the diocese of Ross-shire, which is why the drawing's original title refers to it as 'the Cathedral Church of Ross'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1788, and as not attributed to any artist, is likely to be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. It is one of around five items relating to Kelso in the Hutton Collection, and shows the ruined east end of the abbey church, which is the only substantial part of the abbey complex remaining. To the right of the abbey in the background is the squat clock-tower of Kelso town hall. Built on the north bank of the River Tweed, immediately to the north-east of the ancient burgh and castle of Roxburgh, Kelso Abbey was founded by King David I in 1128. Its inhabitants were Tironensians, a community of monks from Tiron in France who had left the Benedictine order in 1105. In 1550 the abbey was largely destroyed by English troops, and as the Reformation occurred only ten years later, the monks never had a proper chance to rebuild the abbey and revive their dwindling numbers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1788. The drawing, which is one of six views of Jedburgh Abbey in the Hutton Collection, was reproduced in Francis Grose's book 'The Antiquities of Scotland, volume I', which was published in London in 1789. It does not carry the signature of the artist, so it is not clear whether Grose made the drawing himself, or whether it is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This view shows in quite fine detail the southern side and western façade of Jedburgh Abbey, which remains one of the most intact of the great medieval Scottish abbeys. The abbey, situated on the north bank of the Jed Water, was founded in 1138 by King David I. The ostentatious design of the building, which was modelled on European cathedrals, is believed to have been intended as a gesture of defiance towards England. At the time, Scotland and England were in regular dispute about ownership of the border lands around Jedsburgh. Consequently, the Abbey was attacked by invading English troops on many occasions over the subsequent four centuries..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1789, and although not attributed to any artist, is likely to be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. The drawing was made from the south bank of the River Tweed. On the north bank, the ruined tower of the abbey, just to the right of centre, dominates the town of Kelso, and beyond that to the right again is the squat spire of the town hall. The stone bridge on the left of the picture is not the current Kelso Bridge, which was opened in 1803, but is probably its predecessor, which was swept away in a flood in 1797. The Benedictine Abbey at Kelso was founded in 1128 by King David I, for a group of monks from Tiron in France. It grew to become the largest and wealthiest of the four great Border Abbeys, a coronation place and burial place of Scottish Kings. In the mid-sixteenth century, however, it was destroyed by Henry VIII of England's troops, and with the Reformation sweeping away monastic foundations in Scotland in the 1550s and 1560s, Kelso Abbey was never rebuilt..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tombstone in St Columba's Chapel, Eye Peninsula, Isle of Lewis. The carved tombstone appears to show the figure of a warrior in a tunic, clutching a sword. The drawing is not dated but seems to have been the work of William Daniell, who drew a number of items in the Hutton Collection. This is the only image relating to St Columba's Chapel at Eye in the collection. The Eye Peninsula is the easternmost part of Lewis, and is connected to Stornoway and the rest of the island by a very narrow isthmus. The fourteenth-century St Columba's Chapel is the historic burial ground of the Macleod Chiefs of Lewis and the Mackenzies of Seaforth, and the tomb drawn by Daniell was clearly that of a highly regarded head of the Macleod family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The decorative detail on the stone is clearly shown, and measurements have been included in a note underneath the sketch. It has also been recorded that 'no trace of the arms on the two shields remain'. Originally a tombstone for one of the Abbots, at the time of this sketch the stone had been placed on a modern grave at the south side of the church. Fearn Abbey lies in the village of Hill of Fearn and is located around five miles south-east of Tain. The abbey moved to Fearn in the thirteenth century from its original location near Edderton and served as a monastery until the Reformation (1560), after which it became the parish church. Disaster struck in 1742 when the abbey was hit by lightning. Around 40 people were killed and the building itself was so badly damaged that a new church was erected close to the south-west door..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This, untitled, pencil sketch of an archway is thought to have been made at Whithorn Priory. There is very little information attached to it, but it is to be found amongst other images of Whithorn. Most of these other drawings were also completed in 1811. Whithorn Priory church also served as the diocese Cathedral – the church eventually forming the centre of the Galloway diocese. The layout comprised an equidistant choir and nave, both of which were without aisles and then a lady chapel to terminate the building. It is known that in 1684, the western tower and nave were still intact but this state of affairs did not last long and the structure is now roofless..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the east façade of St Duthac's Collegiate Church in Tain, and is dated 1815. The drawing is unsigned by any artist, and is probably the work of George Henry Hutton himself. There are several drawings from Tain in the Hutton Collection, the majority of them depicting this church. St Duthac's Church originates 1360 but was only converted to a collegiate church in 1487, by Thomas Hay, Bishop of Ross. Collegiate churches supported a 'college' of monks or canons who were devoted to theological study and contemplation, but who were often also dedicated to holding special prayers or masses for the family or individual who founded the church. Until the rise of Protestantism in the sixteenth century, the wealthy were often encouraged to found or support churches, on the premise that this was a 'good work' that would help to gain salvation for their souls..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The writing on this drawing continues, 'Drawn by Captain Grose's servant'. 'Captain Grose' is a reference to Francis Grose, an author, antiquary and friend of George Henry Hutton. Grose's servant was named Thomas Cocking, and like his master, Cocking was responsible for several drawings in the Hutton Collection. This is one of a number of items relating to Kelso in the collection. This carved stone may have originated in the ancient burgh or castle of Roxburgh, which stood on a site immediately to the south-west of Kelso, at the confluence of the River Tweed and Teviot Water. Roxburgh's patron saint was St James, and although no trace of the original burgh now remains, its history lives on in the annual fair of St James, which is held on the site of the former burgh. It is probable that this site is the area referred to by Hutton as 'St James's Green'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Inscription from Melrose Abbey, Roxburghshire. A note reveals that the inscription dates from 1788 and that the drawing was actually made on 20th August 1807. It is also recorded that the stele was found against the east wall above the staircase. There are no further details. Although founded in 660, the abbey precinct was burned down in 1385 and so most of the remains date from after this time. The remains are one of the richest sources for medieval and post-medieval carvings, such as this. Other themes captured in stone, in the precinct, include the Virgin’s life, the stories of St James, St Peter, St Catherine and St Thomas. There are also fine examples of decorative motifs such as dragons, gargoyles and flowers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the south-east view of the abbey and is dated September 1815. The artist has also included a note underneath the sketch: 'In the little aisle or chapel adjoining the East end, shown in the view, the Earl of Ross, the Founder, is said to have been interred, and in the Enclosure to the west of it is Abbot McFayd's monument'. Known as the 'Lamp of the North', Fearn Abbey is the most northerly medieval monastery in Scotland and is one of the oldest pre-Reformation churches still used for worship today. Founded in the early-thirteenth century by Ferquhard, Earl of Ross, the abbey was a Premonstratensian house dedicated to St Augustine. The monks remained there until the Reformation (1560), at which point the abbey became the local parish church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here the remains of the castle can be seen halfway up the hill, in the centre of the sketch. The castle still looks much the same and so this image is a good gauge and check of the deterioration process. The castle once comprised a curtain wall 360 metres by 90 metres and four corner towers and the hill has thought to have been a fortified residence since the Saxon age. Roxburgh Castle, also known as Marchmont, was once the property of the crown and then various members of the nobility, most notably the Douglases. As such it played a pivotal role in much of Scotland’s politics and power machinations..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1784, and as not attributed to any artist, is likely to be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. It is the only drawing of Roxburgh Friary in the Hutton Collection, and shows two humble buildings that, in contrast to the grand border abbeys, look like little more than cottages. Roxburgh Friary was located on a peninsula at the confluence of the River Tweed and Teviot Water, adjacent to Roxburgh Castle. The Friary was founded in 1232, and was home to a community of Franciscan monks. It is believed that at one stage, a bridge connected the Friary to Kelso Abbey, which stood east of Roxburgh on the opposite bank of the Tweed. Today nothing of the original burgh of Roxburgh remains, although a hamlet bearing the same name lies approximately two miles to the south-west.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title, date or artist attached to this sheet. There are, however, notes written underneath each sketch. The first sketch is of a knight, with crossed legs, lying on pillow. The effigy lay in a vault near the north door of the Abbey. The other two sketches were made in the Chapter House at Glenluce Abbey. The carvings now preserved is one of the most complete records of a mediaeval design scheme in Europe. Very little information about the Abbey was recorded and all that remains of the early buildings are foundations. There is, however, an impressive but later Chapter House, thought to have been built about 1500, whose structure remains largely intact. The room was vaulted and lit by two large traceried windows. Some of the glazed floor tiles were discovered and there are highly decorated ceiling bosses and corbels..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This untitled drawing shows the ruins of St Duthac's Chapel in Tain. Although the Hutton Collection contains at least ten drawings relating to St Duthac's Collegiate Church, this is the only drawing in the collection that solely depicts St Duthac's Chapel, an older building on a separate site. The drawing is not dated and not signed by the artist, and it is likely that it was the work of George Henry Hutton himself. The ruins of St Duthac's Chapel sit on a grassy knoll overlooking the Dornoch Firth in the north-east part of the burgh of Tain. The chapel is believed to have been built to house the relics of St Duthac or Duthus, which were returned to his home town of Tain from Ireland around 1253. The saint's relics were later moved to St Duthac's Collegiate Church, built a century after the chapel, in the centre of Tain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Pencil sketch of St Duthac's Collegiate Church, Tain, Ross-shire. The double entrance to the church and the arched window above it can be clearly seen, as can the private burial enclosures of the gentry, down the side of the building. This is one of a total of fourteen images captured of the Collegiate Church at Tain, in the Hutton Collection. The original chapel of St Duthac is now situated to the north-east of the town and housed the saint's relics, which were interred in the mid-eleventh century. The village then grew in popularity as place of pilgrimage and sanctuary. It was the latter function which led to its destruction in 1427. The enemy sought refuge within while his pursuer overcame this obstacle by burning the building down. The relics were then translated to the Collegiate Church which had been founded in 1360, thus transferring the pilgrimage and sanctuary functions. St Duthac's remains disappeared during the Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing captures a spectacular view of the remains of St Mary's Chapel, in a rocky bay in the Shiant Islands, south-east of the Isle of Lewis. The drawing is dated 1818 and is the work of William Daniell, who was responsible for several drawings in the Hutton Collection. This is one of two images relating to this site in the collection. The Shiant Islands are made up of twelve islands, only six of which are large and fertile enough to support any vegetation. The Shiants are best known as the habitat of a huge colony of sea-birds, but at least three of the islands have been populated by humans at some time in their history, and Eilean an Tighe remains inhabited. The historic origins of the ruined chapel of St Mary are unknown, but the island on which it sits also carries the name of the saint, being known as Eilean Mhuire, or Mary's Island..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>St Waltheof's tomb from Melrose Abbey, Roxburghshire. The note goes on to explain that the tomb could be found on the south side of the High Altar. The drawing was copied from Gough’s ‘Sepulchural Monuments of Great Britain'. There are other depictions of Melrose Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection which together form a unique record of this ecclesiastical site, captured almost two centuries ago. Melrose Abbey was founded in 660 by St Aidan, with St Boisil enjoying the prestige of being its first Prior. He was then succeeded by the more then famous Prior, St Cuthbert. After this time the abbey fell into gradual decline until 1134. David I founded a new Abbey, occupied by the Cistercian Order. The Cistercians then implemented a building programme which is now famous for its light, ethereal qualities. The Abbot referred to here is most likely to be St Waltheof, who was also the step-son of David I..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the Royal Burgh of Tain in the distance, set within the surrounding countryside. The artist has chosen to include significant landmarks, including (from left to right) St Duthac's Chapel, the Tolbooth, the Collegiate Church and the Academy. The name of the artist has not been included. Tain is famous as the birthplace and final resting place of St Duthac, who was probably born around the ninth or tenth century. It is believed by some that St Duthac's Chapel in Tain was built on the site of his birth. Although St Duthac eventually died in Ireland, his remains were brought to Tain and buried in the chapel. The chapel ruins are still visible today and are located in the old town cemetery..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil drawing, although unsigned and undated, was probably made by George Henry Hutton. It shows the interior of the ruins of Melrose Abbey in the Scottish Borders. Melrose Abbey was founded by King David I in 1136. It was the earliest Cistercian monastery in Scotland, and became one of the wealthiest. Like many ecclesiastical buildings located around the border with England, it was attacked several times by marauding troops. The English sacked the abbey in 1322, 1385 and 1545, after which it never recovered..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no artist’s name attached to this sketch, which shows much of the architectural detail. There are three drawings of this Nunnery to be found amongst the Hutton Drawings. Manuel Nunnery was founded in 1156, as a Cistercian House, by Malcolm IV. The Cistercian Order was concerned with the contemplation and worshipping of God. As a result many of their houses were built in beautiful but relatively secluded spots. Manuel’s situation, on the banks of the River Avon, was therefore ideal. They were also renowned for their clean, soaring architectural style – a reflection of God’s omnipotence. This is clearly highlighted in the detail included in this sketch..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Ruins of Manuel Priory, West Lothian. The Priory of Manuel was built over an earlier Culdee, or Celtic, church foundation which was dedicated to 'Our Lord in his aspect as Emmanuel', hence the new name.

Situated on the banks of the River Avon, the house conformed to the more reclusive and contemplative goals of the order..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Side view of Melrose Abbey, Roxburghshire. It is most probable that Hutton himself copied this sketch from the architect Edward Blore's (1790-1879) original. Blore is most famous for completing Buckingham Palace after John Nash was dismissed from his post, following George IV's death in 1830. Melrose Abbey is one of the most famous abbeys in Scotland, and certainly its ruins are among the most beautiful to be found anywhere in the country. Founded in 1136 by David I, it was settled by monks of the Cistercian Order and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

      <dc:description>South-east view of Cambuskenneth Abbey, Stirlingshire. Other images of the abbey in the Hutton Collection show features of the buildings, as well as long distance prespectives. This is a popular view of the abbey and has been captured down the ages as an embodiment of Scotland’s romantic past. The most famous depiction from this angle, and remarkably similar in layout, is Alexander Kay’s watercolour south view of the abbey, looking towards Stirling, made in about 1830. There is a popular engraving of the abbey also included in the Hutton Collection, which admirably conveys the abbey in context and surrounded by life - a pleasant daydream for many researchers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>West doorway of the Cambuskenneth Abbey Church, Stirlingshire. The drawing is dated 20 July 1789. This image is one of five of Cambuskenneth Abbey which are held in the Hutton Collection. Very little structural evidence of the expansive Cambuskenneth Abbey now remains. The campanile and many of the foundations remain along with this - the arched west entrance to the abbey church. Built sometime during the thirteenth century, this displays all the heavy grandeur, mixed with clean lines which characterise Norman architecture. The church itself would have been a large cruciform shape and the cloisters would have been to the south..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Unfortunately there is no artist’s name attached to this drawing. The architectural details are clearly visible on the arch, as is the remodelling of the arch to create a window space rather than a door space. This is one of five views of Whithorn Priory in the Hutton Collection. Whithorn Priory was established around 1150 by Fergus, Lord of Galloway. It was founded as a Premonstratensian house under the suffragan of the Diocese of York. Fergus, by patronising a large ecclesiastical organisation was following the Royal policies of David I, and thus confirming his support of the King. He was also helping to expand and express his own power as lord of his realm – an important part of mediaeval administration..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing showing the front of Melrose Abbey, Roxburghshire. This faint pencil sketch is undated and unsigned, but it is likely that Hutton himself made this sketch, from the original by Edward Blore (1790-1879). Blore is most celebrated as the architect who completed the renovations on Buckingham Palace, begun by John Nash in 1825. The Cistercian abbey of Melrose was fonded in 1136 by David I and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The church itself is well preserved although the domestic buildings and cloister are in a bad state of repair. The abbey was dissolved after the Reformation in 1560 although the nave was used as a parish church from 1618 to 1810, when it was finally abandoned..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page shows an engraving of Kelso Abbey from the north-east. The engraving is not titled, nor is it attributed to any artist, and there is nothing to suggest what publication or occasion the engraving might have been made for. It appears, however, that it might have been made from a 1788 drawing of Kelso Abbey from the same perspective, also in the Hutton Collection and probably the work of George Henry Hutton himself. This is one of five items relating to Kelso in the collection. Kelso Abbey was founded for a group of Tironensian monks by King David I in 1128, on a site on the north bank of the River Tweed. At that time the principal settlement in the area was Roxburgh, immediately to the south-west, which had held royal burgh status since 1120. The town of Kelso grew up around the abbey, initially starting as a small village, but being granted ecclesiastical burgh status and extended trading rights by 1237, and as Roxburgh went into decline, Kelso became an increasingly important market town which prospered from its location on the main route between Edinburgh and Newcastle..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Cambuskenneth Abbey's campanile, Stirlingshire. The scale has been included along the bottom of the sheet and there is an orientation compass in the top right corner. This plan is one of five depictions of the abbey, which together make a comprehensive record of the site. Very little now remains of this extensive and powerful Abbey complex - simply the bell tower, the arched west doorway of the church and the foundations of most of the complex. The church itself was a large cruciform building, which also formed the north side of the cloisters. The bell tower, to the north, was always unattached to the church, the only example of this in Scotland, making it a campanile. The roof was remodelled in the nineteenth century, but the rest of the tower dates from the thirteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of the north aspect of Inchmahome Priory in the Lake of Menteith. The artist, William M. Stirling, appears to have been a minister based in Port of Menteith in the early nineteenth century. Stirling, who wrote 'Notes, historical and descriptive, on the Priory of Inchmahome' (1815), was responsible for a number of the images of the Priory in the Hutton Collection. A large number of Scottish medieval monastic foundations were destroyed, or went into rapid decline, after the Reformation replaced Roman Catholicism with Presbyterianism as the Established religion of Scotland. Inchmahome was one of those ecclesiastical buildings that fell into ruin after the Reformation, and was never fully restored. However, the chapter house has been re-roofed, and many gravestones and memorials have been moved into it to protect them from the elements..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Descriptive notes of St Fillan's Priory, Strathfillan, Perthshire. These notes are entitled simply 'Strathfillan'. They are undated and unattributed, but the handwriting makes it appear likely that George Henry Hutton was the author. The text of the notes suggest that they may once have been attached to a sketch or drawing of St Fillan's Priory. This is one of four items relating to St Fillan's Priory in the Hutton Collection. The notes read: 'The small remains of walls here exhibited, appear to have been part of the south wall of the Conventual Church, or Chapel. The foundations of the other sides of the Building may be also traced. It is about 36 paces by 11 or 12 over walls. And at the East end of the Ruins, stands the little Kirk, in a ruinous state, a chapel of Ease to the Mother Church, where Divine Service is performed every Sunday. Its external measurt. is about 16 paces by 8'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Coloured drawing of a north view of Inchmahome Priory, Perthshire. This drawing shows Inchmahome Priory from the north shore of the Lake of Menteith in Perthshire. It is dated 1789 and is one of a number of images relating to Inchmahome Priory in the Hutton Collection. The name of the artist is not recorded on the page, and it is likely that this is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. The Lake of Menteith is in the heart of an area of eastern Lowland Scotland rich in medieval royal palaces and castles, and probably because of this, Inchmahome priory has illustrious royal connections. Robert the Bruce is known to have visited the priory on at least three occasions, and its easily defensible location, on an island in the lake, also made it an ideal refuge for the infant Mary Queen of Scots after the Battle of Pinkie in 1547..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Copy of drawing of the west face of Inchmahome Priory. This drawing is not titled. It is a copy of a drawing of the west face of Inchmahome Priory by William M. Stirling, and dates from 1827. William Macgregor Stirling was the minister in the hamlet of Port of Menteith, on the shores of the Lake of Menteith, in the 1820s. He was responsible for several drawings of Inchmahome Priory in the Hutton Collection. The ruins of Inchmahome Priory are stituated on an island in the Lake of Menteith in Perthshire, fifteen miles west of Stirling. The priory was founded in 1238 by Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, for a group of monks of the Augustinian Order. It declined after Reformation of 1560 but was a very significant religious foundation in its day, and was visited on several occasions by King Robert the Bruce, and also by Mary Queen of Scots..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of a monument near Huntingtower, Perthshire. This sketch shows a stone cross that is located just outside Perth, on the road to the historic village of Huntingtower. The halo above the figure's head suggests that it would probably have been some sort of religious symbol. Although the drawing is not dated, it is known to be one of George Henry Hutton's sketches, based on an earlier sketch made by Captain Francis Grose in 1790. A note at the foot of the drawing reads, 'Cross about three miles from Perth, on the road to Huntingtower - From a sketch by the late Capt Grose June 1790'. Captain Francis Grose made many fine drawings of Scottish churches and landmarks, and is well known for his book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton, who drew many plans of famous Scottish buildings during the early 1800s, made this plan in 1813. The Roman numerals that appear in the plan indicate the main rooms and areas, and correspond with the numbered list that is included at the bottom right corner of the drawing. The scale is at the foot of the page. Known as the palace of Holyroodhouse or Holyrood House, the Queen's official residence in Scotland was originally founded as a monastery by David I in 1128. Located at the bottom of the Royal Mile, the palace is rich in history, and is particularly associated with Mary, Queen of Scots, who lived here from 1561 to 1567. Until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI left Scotland to become the King of England, Holyrood Palace was where the Scottish royal court was held..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a copy of a drawing of St Nicholas Hospital and part of the Bishop's Palace, Glasgow 'from a drawing in the possession of Mr Wilson, Bookseller, Glasgow, 1813'. The name of the artist is unknown. Hutton's note beneath the title reads, 'N.B. This Hospital was pulled down to make way for a new street, about the year 1810'. Perhaps surprisingly, this is the only drawing or sketch from Glasgow contained in the Hutton Collection. St Nicholas's Hospital and the Bishop's Palace stood in the heart of medieval Glasgow, just yards from Glasgow Cathedral. St Nicholas's Hospital was not a hospital in the modern sense, but rather an alms house, which was endowed by Bishop Andrew Muirhead of Glasgow to provide care for twelve old men. It may date from between 1456 and 1471. Provand's Lordship, the oldest surviving house in Glasgow, which dates from 1471, was attached to the hospital and served as the manse of the Master or Preceptor of St Nicholas's Hospital chapel..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a copy of a print of Dunkeld Cathedral, Perthshire. There is no information about either the original or the copy. This is one of two images relating to Dunkeld Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. This view shows the southern aspect of Dunkeld Cathedral, in its setting among hills on the north bank of the River Tay. The cathedral grew up in stages between 1260 and 1501, on the site of an eight-century Celtic monastery. The Reformation of 1560 partially destroyed the Cathedral. Restored, it served as Dunkeld's parish church at the start of the seventeenth century but the Jacobite rising of 1689 badly damaged it again. Much remains in ruin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan of Trinity College Kirk is by Andrew Morton in 1813. Mary of Guelders, wife of James II, founded the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity in 1460. She dedicated the church to the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Mary, Saint Ninian the Confessor and 'all the saints and elect people of God'. A fine example of Scottish Gothic architecture, the church was located in the hollow between the New and the Old Town sections of Edinburgh. The City demolished the Church in 1848 to make may for Waverley Rail Station..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Restalrig Loch and the ruins of Restalrig (also known as Lochend) Castle, Mid-Lothian. There are no names or dates attached to this colour drawing but it is one of two images of Restalrig amongst the Hutton Collection. The building on the hill is the ruined remains of the old Castle of the Logan family. People commonly know this area and the loch as Lochend. The land around Restalrig, and the village itself, was once the possession of the de Lestalric family. They may have been Norman immigrants, who arrived under David I's settlement policy. The first mention of them and their Restalrig lands was in 1198 and it was in connection with ecclesiastical patron, and so recorded by Dunfermline Abbey. The name may be a corruption of their family name. The Logans of Coatfield eventually took possession of the de Lestalric barony and built their own stronghold on this hill..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton, who drew many plans of Scottish church buildings during the early 1800s, made this one of Torphichen Preceptory, West Lothian, in 1813. The numbers included on the plan correspond with the numbered list on the right side of the drawing, and indicate the rooms and main areas of the building. In contrast to Morton's other plans, the exact dimensions of each room and area are not included on the drawing. Founded by David I of Scotland in 1153, Torphichen Preceptory was the Scottish seat of the Knights Hospitallers or Knights of St John of Jerusalem. The nave, transept and choir date from around 1300, and traces of them still exist. However, little now remains of the domestic buildings and the cloister. The building changed a lot during the fifteenth century, while the parish church appeared on this site in 1756..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is the second of two copies in the Hutton Collection of a plan that was inset in the 1805 edition of James Stobie's 'The counties of Perth and Clackmannan', originally published in 1783. This is one a large number of images from Perth and Perthshire that were collected by Hutton. This plan shows in fine detail the medieval layout of Perth and later development of the city, and annotations identify Perth's foremost public buildings. The High Street, running west to east in the centre of the plan, was designed in the twelfth century along typical Scottish lines. However, South Street, running parallel to the High Street, was developed shortly afterwards, and this gave Perth's town centre a square appearance that was unusual in Scotland, and led some early antiquaries to believe, erroneously, that the town must have had Roman origins..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of a bridge at the Falls of Bruar, Perthshire is undated, but may be about 1794. The inclusion of 'Duke of Athol' in the title is probably a reference to the owner of the land around the Falls of Bruar.This is the only drawing relating to Bruar in the Hutton Collection. The Falls of Bruar are located on the Bruar water about three miles north-west of Blair Atholl, in northern Perthshire. The falls divide naturally into three sections, known as the lower falls, middle falls and upper falls. Similar stone bridges cross both the lower and upper falls. It is likely that the bridge shown in this drawing is the upper bridge..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Coloured drawing of the west face of Inchmahome Priory, Perthshire. This drawing depicts the ornate arches of the west face of Inchmahome Priory. The name of the artist does not appear to be noted on the page, but it is believed that the colour was added to the original drawing by Paul Sandby (1725-1809), an accomplished English draughtsman.

      <dc:description>This plan of St John the Baptist Collegiate Church, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, dates from 1813. It is by Alexander Morton, who drew many plans of Scottish church buildings during the early 1800s. The numbers included on the plan correspond with the numbered list on the left side of the drawing, and indicate the rooms and main areas of the building. Unlike Morton's other church plans, the exact dimensions of each room and area are not included on this drawing. There are records of church buildings having existed on this site from at least as early as 1128. However, the Collegiate Church of St John the Baptist is especially associated with the Forrester family, who lived in the city during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Sir Adam Forrester, a provost of Edinburgh, built a chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist in the late-fourteenth century. His son, Sir John Forrester, raised the church to collegiate status in 1429. The church is now the parish church of Corstorphine..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton, who drew many fine plans of Scottish church buildings during the early 1800s, made this plan of St Gile's Cathedral in 1817. The Roman numerals that appear in the plan indicate the main rooms and areas in the cathedral, and correspond with the numbered list that is included at the left hand side of the drawing. One of Scotland's most famous cathedrals, St Giles' is after a French saint, in honour of the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France. Also known as the High Kirk of Edinburgh, the Bishop of St. Andrews officially consecrated it in 1243, although the massive pillars in the building date back to 1120. Rich in history, St Gile's is particular associated with the Scottish Reformation, as John Knox preached here during the sixteenth century. Legend has it that it was also here that Jenny Geddes threw her chair at the minister when Charles I tried to impose Laud’s new prayer book in 1637..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>William Daniell drew this plan of St Magnus’ Cathedral in 1818. There are eight views of the Cathedral in the Hutton Collection and William Daniell completed four of them. Daniell had established his reputation as a landscape painter by this time, but unusually, three of his Cathedral drawings are of the interior. Kirkwall today retains an air of antiquity due to street system and the appearance of the houses. There was a huge expansion in the fishing industry during the seventeenth century, which stabilized into the eighteenth. This resulted in more modern, stone Burgh houses replacing many of the timber Norse buildings. They have narrow gable ends, facing the street, and spread out along the main street in the town. This layout was subsequently, never interfered with as new buildings were established on the newly reclaimed land, or around the edges of the town..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton has signed the bottom right corner, of this plan of the Carmelite Church, South Queensferry, on 10th May 1813. The top left corner also carries a note about the cloister remains. The plan contains a scale, along the bottom, a navigation compass and key to the notation used on the plan. Although the house was founded in 1330, the remains shown on this plan mainly date from the 1440s. The only standing parts of the church at this time were the choir, tower, south transept and nave. The nave collapsed later into this century and was, unusually, shorter than the choir was. In 1889, the Episcopalian community refurbished the whole building for worship.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This incomplete drawing, made in 1783, shows the Old Bridge over the River Tay at Perth, as viewed from the east bank and looking south. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been George Hutton himself. The artist who drew this sketch would have been upriver, looking down towards the bridge, with the city of Perth located on the right side of the sketch. The Old Bridge, also known as Smeaton's Bridge, was built in 1771, and replaced the ferry. The original bridge was destroyed in a flood in 1621. Taking four years to construct, at a cost of £26,631 (about £2,129,000 in today's terms), the bridge was named after the engineer who built it, John Smeaton..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketch of remains of St Fillan's Priory, Strathfillan, Perthshire. It is dated September 8th 1820, and although not signed, is likely to be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. This is one of four views of Strathfillan in the Hutton Collection. The area takes its name from St Fillan, who is reputed to have founded the priory there in the eighth century. A note beneath the title of this sketch reads: 'The little wall on the left, below the Ruins, is modern, &amp; contains the monument of a man who was drowned in 1808 when bathing in the adjacent River Fill'. Another note identifies the Kirk, or church, in the right foreground of the sketch..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketched plan is one of four views of Hamilton Collegiate Church, Lanarkshire, contained in the Hutton Collection. It is unsigned by the artist. The measurements of most of the walls are given in feet, but some distances are measured in paces, and beside an incomplete line, perhaps indicating a gap in the walls of the building, a note reads, 'Should meet the line of 15 paces at right angles'. Hamilton Collegiate Church was located on a site close to the River Clyde and adjoining the family seat of the Barons of Cadzow, later Dukes of Hamilton. The church was founded by Sir James Hamilton, 6th Lord Cadzow, in 1450-1, and was dedicated to St Mary, although it is not associated with the current St Mary's Church in Hamilton. With the exception of the transept housing the Hamilton family burial vaults, the church was demolished in the eighteenth century while Hamilton Palace was being extended..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of the Weigh House, Edinburgh. The Weigh House stood in Edinburgh's West Bow, in the centre of Castlehill Street where it intersects with Lawnmarket and Johnston Terrace. In this quick sketch, the artist has created a sense of the bustling city by including a human figure and passing traffic. Another name for the Weigh House was the Butter Tron, as it was where butter and cheese were on sale. The English destroyed the first weigh house in 1384, but the Town Council built a new one in 1614. However, Cromwell's troops destroyed the second building in 1650. The building shown here dates from 1660. It finally disappeared in 1822 in order to widen the road for King George IV's visit..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This untitled drawing depicts the Tron Church, which is located in the Royal Mile, at the junction between the High Street and the South Bridge. Although the name of the artist is not included, the sketch dates from around 1781. King Charles I founded the Tron Kirk in 1637, to house the displaced congregation from nearby St Giles, after it became a cathedral. The Tron Church is named after a salt-tron, which was a public weighing beam that was previously located outside the church's main entrance. The original wooden spire was burnt down in 1824, and was replaced by a stone spire. Although it remains open as tourist attraction, the church closed its doors to its congregation in 1952..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, was probably made by George Henry Hutton himself, although no artist is named. Inchaffray Abbey was founded in 1200. Maurice, Abbot of Inchaffray, was chaplain to Robert the Bruce and carried relics of St Fillan before the Scottish army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Laurence Oliphant, a later Abbot at Inchaffray, was killed at the Battle of Flodden 200 years later..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Under the title of this watercolour, there is a note that appears to have read 'as it stood in 1806'. The artist's surname is Turnbull, and this is one of at least two views of Peebles Cross Church in the Hutton Collection painted by this artist. Standing on an elevated position on the west bank of the Eddleston Water, you can still see the remains of Peebles Cross Church today, although much of what was once there has disappeared. A Trinitarian monastery was an addition to the thirteenth-century church in 1473-4, but fell into disuse after the Reformation in 1560. The Monastery became building stone, while the church was temporarily the parish church of Peebles. When a new parish church opened in 1784, the Cross Church fell into complete ruin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour of the west end of Peebles Cross Church, Peeblesshire, is undated, but the surname of the artist is Turnbull. This is one of at least eight views of Peebles Cross Church in the Hutton Collection. The doorways shown here in Turnbull's painting were probably part of the main entrance into Peebles Cross Church. It was traditional in medieval church design for the entrance to be in the west wall, at the opposite end of the church from the altar. Altars were usually at the east end, because the Mosaic laws communicated by God to Moses in the Old Testament stipulated that the apostles should pray facing the east. The Cross Church, whose remains still stand in Peebles, dates from AD 1261..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This print of Holyrood House shows the north-west view of the building, with Arthur's Seat providing the background. The ruins of the chapel are to the left of the palace. The original drawing appeared in Volume I of Captain Francis Grose's book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1789. Located at the bottom of the Royal Mile, the palace of Holyroodhouse or Holyrood House was established as a monastery by David I of Scotland in 1128. The Queen's official residence in Scotland, the baroque palace is rich in history, and is especially associated with the royal Stewarts. Mary, Queen of Scots, lived here from 1561 to 1567, while her son, James VI, resided here until the Union of the Crowns took him to England in 1603. Although the palace was neglected after James VI left for England, it was renovated by Queen Victoria during the nineteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour drawing of Dunblane Cathedral, Stirlingshire shows the cathedral set within its own grounds. The artist also includes two figures in the foreground, possibly to offer perspective, and a number of nearby buildings. The Hutton Collection also includes views of the south-east and distant south-east, and an elevation of the east window. Although this drawing is undated, it was probably before the late-nineteenth century. The artist has clearly shown the roofless nave, which was not restored to its former glory until 1893. The deterioration began during the Reformation and continued for years; whilst the choir remained in constant use, the roof of the nave finally fell in around 1600 leaving the interior open to the elements for almost 300 years..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Print of the southern aspect of Dunkeld Cathedral, Perthshire. It is one of two copies of the same print in the Hutton Collection. There is no information about the date or the artist of either the original or the copy. In addition to the two copies of this drawing, there is one other image relating to Dunkeld Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. Dunkeld is one of the earliest known ecclesiastical centres in Scotland. The Pictish King Constantine may have established a religious foundation there in 729, and a later abbey, founded by Celtic Culdee monks from Iona, existed by 820. The relics of St Columba moved from Iona to Dunkeld in 849, establishing Dunkeld as the principal religious centre in the new Kingdom of Scotland. David I confirmed Dunkeld's status as a bishopric in 1127. The stone Cathedral, pictured here, dates from about 1234 and had extensions in the fifteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>These lines of poetry are the third canto from a poem, here entitled 'Quod Inschemachame'. They are written on the back of an 1815 pencil sketch of Inchmahome Priory by William MacGregor Stirling, who was the parish minister at Port of Menteith. The poem was published in Stirling's 'Notes, historical and descriptive, on the Priory of Inchmahome' (Edinburgh: Printed by J. Ballantyne and Co. for W. Blackwood, 1815). This is one of a number of images relating to Inchmahome Priory in the Hutton Collection. The thirteenth-century Augustinan Priory of Inchmahome stands on an island in the Lake of Menteith, Perthshire. Documents signed by King Robert Bruce at Inchmahome indicated that he visited the priory on at least three occasions, in 1305, 1308 and 1310. It is appropriate, then, that the lines shown here are about Bruce's heroism..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This print, dated 1775, shows the front view of Scone Palace, which is located by the village of Scone, near Perth. The print was made by A. Rutherford, whose name appears at the bottom right of the drawing, and a note underneath the title states it was 'Sold by J Ainslie of Parliament Square', which is a central Edinburgh address. Originally the capital of Pictavia, Scone Palace was traditionally the crowning venue for Scottish monarchs, hence its association with the Stewarts and the Stone of Destiny. Strategically located by the River Tay and the road to the Highlands, the Bishops' Palace and the Abbey of Scone were destroyed by a mob during the Reformation era. The Gowrie family built a new palace in 1580, and this is the beautiful building that exists today. Following 'the Gowrie Conspiracy' against James VI of Scotland in 1600, however, the thankful King gifted the palace and its grounds to Sir David Murray as a reward for his loyalty..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated drawing depicts Edinburgh Castle, as viewed from Princes Street. The bridge in the bottom right corner crossed over the loch that previously existed at this point in the Princes Street Gardens. It is quite likely to have been Hutton himself who made this drawing. Located on top of an old volcano 300 feet above sea level, Edinburgh Castle boasts an eagle-eye's view of the surrounding area. Although there has probably been a fort here for about 3000 years, the modern castle is a mixture of buildings constructed over various centuries. The famous Castle Esplanade is immediately below the flag to the left of the drawing, and is the location for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, which takes place during the festival in August..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dated 1784, shows a panoramic view of the city of Edinburgh, as viewed from the south and looking in a north-easterly direction. In the middle of the drawing, it is possible to discern the vague outlines of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. The artist of this sketch is unknown. Arthur's Seat is an extinct volcano that is located in the middle of the city. There is some debate regarding who or what the volcano is named after, with some people believing is named after King Arthur of Round Table fame, while others maintain that it was named in honour of a local hero who had nothing to do with the King Arthur legend. Salisbury Crags are the spectacular remains of glaciated rock formations, and, like Arthur's Seat, are located in Holyrood Park..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Date of event depicted: 1560</dc:description>
      <dc:description>This untitled sketch is of an inscribed stone in South Leith Parish Church. The inscription appears to comprise a crown or mace and the number sixty. There are no notes on the page to indicate the significance of the inscription, but two possible subjects may be the destruction of the church, which occurred in 1560, or the coronation of George III in 1760. The sketch is not dated, and is unsigned. South Leith Church grew out of a chapel founded about 1483. The chapel was partially destroyed when Protestant Lords of Congregation bombarded Leith during the Reformation, and the restored building became the parish church of Leith in 1609. The current South Leith Parish Church was erected on the same site in 1847-8. It incorporates some stones and memorials from the previous buildings..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil sketch bears the date 1781. The artist is unknown. Crichton Castle is about two miles south of Pathhead. It originated as a fourteenth-century tower house, but grew in the fifteenth century into an impressive castle. It is especially famous for Earl Bothwell's Lodging, one of the earliest and most impressive examples of Renaissance architecture in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is an inset from the 'corrected to 1805' edition of James Stobie's 'The counties of Perth and Clackmannan', originally engraved by Thomas Condor, and published in London in 1783. This edition was printed by J. Morison, in Perth, in 1805. It reveals much about the nature of life in 'the fair city' of Perth, towards the end of the eighteenth century. For instance, a cavalry barracks can be seen to the left of the main buildings' list, while an artillery barracks exists immediately left of the word 'Tay'. The famous Perth racecourse surrounds the map title at the top of the page..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This ink sketch is undated and unsigned by the artist. It is one of at least eight images of Peebles Cross Church in the collection. This sketch looks as if the artist was standing inside the ruins of Peebles Cross Church. There is a figure standing by bushes in the church grounds. The church has a largely rural setting, to the north of Peebles' town centre overlooking the Eddleston Water. The location was reputedly the site of an ancient stone cross, but at the time of its foundation, in 1261, it would have lain closer to the centre of Peebles than it does today. Originally, built north of the Eddleston water, the town relocated to a more defensible site between the Eddleston and the Tweed in the sixteenth century, after English troops had burned it down several times..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch of a south-west view of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, shows the main entrance and western façade. The sketch, which dates from 1813, is unsigned and may be by George Henry Hutton himself. This is the only image relating to Paisley Abbey in the Hutton Collection. Paisley, on the White Cart Water in Renfrewshire south-west of Glasgow, has long been an important ecclesiastical site in Scotland. St Mirren reputedly established a Celtic monastery there in the eighth century and, in 1163, Walter Fitz-Alan founded a Cluniac Priory that became an abbey in 1219. Destroyed by English troops in 1307, rebuilt in the fifteenth century, it partially collapsed in 1533. The work, which restored the building to its present impressive state, took place between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page is not titled, but the sketch on it is of a sculpted stone that was set in the wall of an alms house or hospital in Leith. The words on the stone read: 'IN • THE • NAME • OF • THE LORD • VE • MASTERIS AND • MARENELIS • BYLIS THIS • HOVS • TO • VE • POVR ANNO DOMM • 1555'. The sketch is not dated and is unsigned. The Masters and Mariners of Trinity House, Leith's oldest and wealthiest trade incorporation, built the alms house or hospital in which this sculpted stone was set. At that date, in the sixteenth century, 'hospital' did not necessarily refer to an institution that provided medical care, but might rather be a place where the poor received some sort of food, shelter or financial relief. The original building came down in 1816, but the sculpted stones were preserved and incorporated into a new Trinity House, built on the same site as a guildhall for the trade incorporation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketch of a north-west view of St Fillan's Priory, Perthshire. It is dated September 8th 1820, and although unsigned by the artist, is probably the work of George Henry Hutton himself. A note under the title reads, 'with the Hills of Cruachandoren in the distance'. A second note, in the bottom right corner of the sketch, identifies 'The Road to Tynedrum'. This is one of four images relating to St Fillan's Priory in the Hutton Collection. The ruined eighth-century Culdee Priory of St Fillan is located in Strathfillan, at the east end of Loch Earn in Perthshire. This sketch gives a wider view of the setting than the other views of the priory in the Hutton Collection. One of the two buildings to the left of centre is probably the chapel of ease, which was still in use in the early nineteenth century. The ruined walls of the priory are evident slightly to the right of centre, beyond the farmland and sketched labourers that occupy the foreground. In the background are the dramatic peaks of Ben Cruachan and Ben Dorain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although this sketch of a north-west view of Peebles Cross Church is undated and unsigned by the artist, it is likely that this was one of George Henry Hutton's own works. It is one of a number of views of Peebles Cross Church in the Hutton Collection. Peebles Cross Church was so-called because it was founded on a site where an ancient stone cross once stood, slightly to the north of the medieval burgh of Peebles. Legend has it that an urn containing the relics of the martyr St Nicholas was also found at the site, and consequently, the church was dedicated to St Nicholas by its founder Alexander III. A niche in the south wall of the church represents the reputed last resting place of St Nicholas's relics..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Restalrig Collegiate Church, Mid-Lothian, signed by Alexander Morton and dated 1813. Below this is an explanation of Morton's notation and the plan itself has compass points written onto it. The hexagonal shape in the middle of the plan is the only example of this shape of rib-vaulted room in Scotland, and as such is outstanding. The building itself houses St Triduana's well, a shrine to the saint, which was also renowned for its healing properties. There was a new trend prevalent in late-fifteenth-century Scottish society for the foundation of collegiate, or corporate, churches. In keeping with this trend, the Logan family built St Margaret's Church, incorporating St Triduana's Well, in 1487 as a gift to King James III. Seven or eight priests then said prayers and masses for the King and the Logan family. The chapel was partially destroyed in 1560 and partially undermined by St Triduana's well and as a result restoration work was carried out in 1837..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketch of a north view of St Fillan's Priory, Strathfillan, Perthshire. It is dated 13th July 1789, but is unsigned by the artist. This is one of four images relating to St Fillan's Priory in the Hutton Collection. Of the other three, one image is undated, and two are dated 1820. It is quite possible, however, that George Henry Hutton was responsible for all four images, as his career as an amateur antiquary spanned almost forty years. The remains of St Fillan's Priory stand in Strathfillan at the east end of Loch Earn in Perthshire. The priory is reputed to have been founded by St Fillan, the son of St Kentigern, in the eighth century. Little remains of the priory beyond the foundations, as it was quarried to provide building stone for surrounding farms, but the ruins suggest that the priory complex was once quite extensive..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of a north-east view of St Andrew's Collegiate Church, Peebles. The page, which is dated 1802, is unsigned by the artist, and the drawing may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. There are a number of drawings made in Peebles in the Hutton Collection, but only two are views of St Andrew's Collegiate Church. St Andrew's in Peebles was one of the latest churches in Scotland to become collegiate, a status it attained in 1542. The church itself had existed since 1195. Collegiate status means a college of secular canons establishing themselves at a church. The canons dedicated their lives to ecclesiastical learning, and to holding special prayers and masses for the souls of the individuals and families who had been founders or sponsors of the church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The drawing of the Monastery, which is dated 1801, is unsigned by the artist, and may be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. This is one of several pictures of Peebles Cross Church, made from different perspectives, in the Hutton Collection. Peebles Cross Church or Kirk stands to the north of the modern town of Peebles, on the west bank of the Eddleston Water. Peebles High Street and market cross were originally west of the Eddleston, nearer the Cross Kirk, but after repeated burnings by English invaders, the town centre moved to a more defensible position east of the river in the sixteenth century. The name Monastery of the Holy Cross, used in the title of this drawing, is from a Trinitarian attached to the thirteenth century church in 1474..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of a monument in Dunkeld Cathedral, Perthshire is undated and unsigned. [The pencil note ('in the Cathedral Church of Dunkeld'), apparently added by Hutton, suggests, however, that this may not be his work.] This is one of two images relating to Dunkeld Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. 'Lord Badenoch', who is commemorated by this monument, was Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, the second son of King Robert II of Scotland. Known as the 'Wolf of Badenoch', Stewart was notorious for his acts of lawlessness, which included burning down the towns of Forres and Elgin in 1390. The monument sits behind the High Altar in Dunkeld Cathedral..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The drawing is dated 1788 but is unsigned by the artist. This is one of two drawings from Elcho in the Hutton Collection, the other being a view of Elcho Castle. The remains of the nunnery at Elcho stand near Elcho Castle, on the south bank of the Tay about three miles south-east of Perth. Apparently founded by David Lindsay of Glenesk, this was the only Cistercian nunnery in Scotland north of the Forth. It burnt in 1548..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1783 but is unsigned by the artist. This is one of several images in the Hutton Collection relating to Gowrie House, referred to by Hutton as Gowrie Castle. Gowrie House was a baronial mansion overlooking the River Tay, at the east end of present-day South Street in Perth. Before demolition in 1809, it had an eventful history. In 1600, attendants of King James VI killed its owner, the third Earl of Gowrie, there, along with his brother. In the eighteenth century, the Town presented the house to the Duke of Cumberland, who sold the House to the British government for use as a military barracks..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the remains of the old priory on Priory Island in Loch Tay, Perthshire. The drawing is dated 1789, and may be the work of George Henry Hutton himself, as no other artist is credited on the page. This is one of at least five items relating to Loch Tay in the Hutton Collection. Priory Island, at the east end of Loch Tay, is also known by the Scots Gaelic name Eilean nan Bannoamh, which means 'Isle of the Female Saints'. This name is a reference to Queen Sybilla, wife of King Alexander I of Scotland, who is believed to have died on the island in 1122 or slightly earlier. The island later became known as Priory Island, after the priory reputedly founded there by monks from Scone, in memory of Queen Sybilla..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The drawing, which is dated 1796 and unsigned by the artist, is a south-west view of Peebles Cross Church, Peeblesshire and may be the work of Hutton himself. It is one of a number of views of the Cross Church in the Hutton Collection. The remains of the church and the surrounding countryside are in bold pencil strokes, but in addition, in the foreground, the artist has included a fainter outline drawing of a plough pulled by a team of oxen, which provides an indication that this was farming country without obscuring the view of the church. The Cross Church or Cross Kirk in Peebles, founded in 1261, got its name because it stood on the site of an ancient stone cross. The church commemorates St Nicholas..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of the Carmelite Church, South Queensferry. There is no artist's name attached to this sketch. You can see the ruined state of the nave here, although they rebuilt it in 1889. There is some controversy surrounding the origins of the Carmelite Order, with many researchers believing it has a direct link to early Christianity. However, the first official record of the order is dated 1155. The Carmelite Order began as a contemplative, hermetical lifestyle, although community living became more popular in the thirteenth century. It remains one of the most strict and extreme of the mendicant houses. This establishment at Queensferry is one of twelve houses founded in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of a west view of the Church of the Holy Cross, later known as Cross Kirk, Peebles, dates from 4th October 1800, but is unsigned by the artist. There are at least seven other drawings or sketches of this same church in the Hutton Collection. The title of this drawing refers to Peebles Cross Church or Kirk by its pre-Reformation name. Alexander III of Scotland founded the Church in 1261. It is the Church of the Holy Rood or Cross after an ancient cross that stood on the same site. In the fifteenth century, a Trinitarian monastery joined the Church. It is almost certain that the monastery's life ended with the Reformation of 1560, when the Cross Kirk temporarily became the parish church of Peebles..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in 1781, depicts the ruins of Borthwick Castle, which is located beside the village of Borthwick, twelve miles south of Edinburgh. As the drawing shows, the castle stands strategically on the summit of a knoll, in order to make it more difficult to attack. The name of the artist is not included. Built in 1430 by the first Lord Borthwick, Borthwick Castle is a twin-towered baronial keep, steeped in history. It is particularly famous as the place where Mary, Queen of Scots and the Earl of Bothwell escaped to in 1567, after taking flight from Edinburgh. Local legend has it that Mary’s ghost haunts the Red Room in the castle. When the castle was besieged, Mary only escaped by disguising herself as a man. The ghost that is rumoured to haunt the castle is Mary dressed up as a page-boy..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Sinclair family may have established itself in the Lothian area under the ‘Normanisation’ programme which David I is supposed to have instigated. The family hailed from Saint-Clair-sur-l'Epte in Normandy and Henry de St Clair of Roslin was granted lands in 1162. The family were always closely involved in Scottish politics and bought their Orkney Earldom from King Hakon of Norway in 1379. King James swapped this title for Ravenscraig Castle in Fife, in 1470, as he felt the Earls were too powerful..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The drawing, which is dated 1781, is unsigned by the artist, but may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. It is the only picture relating to Comrie Castle in the Hutton Collection. 'Cushville' is these days more commonly spelled 'Coshieville' and is a hamlet near Aberfeldy. Comrie Castle is reasonably removed from the Perthshire village of Comrie, lying approximately twenty miles further north on the banks of the River Lyon, in the parish of Dull. The tower house dates from the sixteenth century, and was built by the Menzies family as a replacement for their stronghold of the same name, which was destroyed by fire in 1488, and its successor, the palace of Weem, which was burned in 1502. The castle has been uninhabited since 1748 and is now largely ruinous..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in 1781, shows Craigmillar Castle, the ruins of which are located in the south-east part of Edinburgh. By the time of this drawing, the castle was already becoming a ruin, as highlighted by the missing roof. The artist is unknown. King David I of Scotland granted the lands and houses at Craigmillar to Dunfermline Abbey during the twelfth century, although there is no record of a castle then existing. Often used by Scots royalty, it is most likely that the Preston family started the building of Craigmillar Castle in 1374, after John de Capella awarded them the Barony for the region. The castle boasts a rich history, and is particularly associated with Mary, Queen of Scots, and her husband, the ill-fated Lord Darnley. A nearby village was home to Mary's French servants. This still has the name of 'Little France'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing depicts the Collegiate Church at Crichton, which is located in the village of Crichton, in Midlothian. The name of the artist has not been included. William Crichton, the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, founded Crichton Collegiate Church in 1449. Located close to the remnants of Crichton Castle, the church is in memory of St Kentigern, St Mungo and St Mary. The church's original design was unusual because it had no nave. They restored it in 1898.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is not dated but may be from about 1781. Although the page is unsigned, it appears likely that the artist was George Henry Hutton himself, who seems to have drawn several different castles in west Perthshire in 1781. This is the only image relating to Doune Castle in the Hutton Collection. Doune Castle sits on an elevated site overlooking the River Teith at Doune, north-west of Stirling. The castle dates from the late-fourteenth century, built for Robert Stewart, first Duke of Albany, who was the regent of Scotland from 1406 until 1420 during the imprisonment of the young James I by the English. Despite the fortress-like appearance of the castle, it was mainly a hunting lodge for monarchs throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Sir James Stewart, first Lord Doune, assumed ownership of the castle in 1570, and eventually, through marriage, the castle became part of the estates of the Earls of Moray, to whom it has belonged ever since..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1783, but is unsigned by the artist. It appeared in Captain Francis Grose's book 'The Antiquities of Scotland, volume II', published by Samuel Hooper of London in 1791. There are several pictures from Grose's books in the Hutton Collection. Elcho Castle stands on the south bank of the River Tay about three miles south-east of Perth. James III of Scotland granted lands to the Wemyss family in 1468, although the present castle probably dates from about 1570. Originally, the castle comprised the large central tower house that still stands today, and smaller buildings ranged round a courtyard to the south. In the 1830s, however, the Eighth Earl of Wemyss demolished most of the minor buildings..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dates from 15th September 1814, is unsigned by the artist, and it appears likely that this is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. Beneath the title and date, a note, apparently by Hutton, reads, 'B. a little footbridge. Put a female at the right side loading clothes in a tub'. The first part of the note explains an annotation on the drawing. The second part appears to be a suggested addition for a more finished drawing of the scene. Fowlis Easter is a hamlet in the Sidlaw Hills, several miles north-west of Dundee. Its first church dated from 1142, and in 1452-3 Sir Andrew, first Lord Gray, built the collegiate church depicted in this drawing on the same site. It remains intact, and is one of the best preserved fifteenth-century churches in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1781, and although it is unsigned, it is likely that the artist was George Henry Hutton himself, and that the picture was drawn in the same period as the drawing of nearby Comrie Castle. This is the only image relating to Garth Castle in the Hutton Collection. The square tower house of Garth Castle stands in the Strath of Appin, in north-west Perthshire. Dating from the fourteenth century, the castle was a stronghold of the Royal Stewart family, and may be by Alexander Stewart, Lord of Buchan (1343-c.1406). Stewart, more famously known as the 'Wolf of Badenoch', was the younger son of King Robert II of Scotland, and became notorious for his lawless behaviour, which included burning the towns of Forres and Elgin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title of this drawing is 'Gowrie Castle, Perth, looking north'. It is dated 1783 but is unsigned by the artist. It is likely, however, that this was one of George Henry Hutton's own drawings. He appears to have made a series of studies of the Gowrie House in 1783, some of which are engravings that also appear in the Hutton Collection. Gowrie House, on the banks of the Tay in Perth, was the town residence of the Earls of Gowrie until James VI forfeited the family in the early seventeenth century. This occurred after a dispute, which had seen the third earl, and his brother killed in an alleged assassination attempt on the King. Thereafter the house was mooted as the site for a new university, belonged briefly to the Duke of Cumberland, and finally served as a military barracks before its demolition in 1809..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing s dated 1783, and although not signed by the artist, it is likely that this was one of Hutton's own drawings. There are several views of Gowrie House in the Hutton Collection, most of which date from this period. In the late eighteenth century, Gowrie House was in use as a military barracks, and several of the Hutton Collection from this period contain evidence of this. In the drawing shown here, a sentry box stands in the courtyard to the right of centre, and what may be ammunition boxes are piled against a wall beyond the sentry box. The house was became a barracks after it had been sold by the Duke of Cumberland, to whom it was gifted by Perth Burgh Council during the Jacobite Rising of 1745-6. Gowrie House was demolished in 1809..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of Inchaffray Abbey, Perthshire. It is dated June 18th 1781, and although not signed, it is likely that this is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This is one of three views of Inchaffray Abbey in the Hutton Collection. The ruins of Inchaffray Abbey stand by the Pow Water in the valley of Strathearn, Perthshire. The abbey was founded as an Augustinian priory in 1200, by the Earl of Strathearn, and was inhabited by canons previously based at Scone. In about 1220-1, the priory was raised to the status of an abbey, and in the early fourteenth century its Abbot is reputed to have served as chaplain to King Robert the Bruce. By the fifteenth century the abbey was indecline, and eventually it was used as a quarry for building stone..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>William Daniell may have drawn this sketch, possibly during his sojourn on the island in 1818. Daniell made three sketches of the interior of the Cathedral although there are a further eight views of the building held in the Hutton Drawings. The eighteenth century had seen very little expansion or progression in Kirkwall as developments tended to focus on the more popular fishing village of Stromness. The nineteenth century, however, saw much of the natural Peerie Sea harbour reclaimed so that the town could expand. Money went into two new piers – East and West – and a new connecting road between them, for improved access. This resulted in the bottom-half of the town’s more modern architectural look..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The ramparts and walls of Leith Fort are in the right foreground of the drawing, with the rooftops and harbour of Leith in the middle distance in the centre of the picture. The Bass Rock and the distinctive peak of North Berwick Law are on the left-hand side of the page, and appear so distant that they are quite difficult to see. The drawing is dated 1784, but is unsigned by the artist. Leith Fort dates from shortly before this 1779 drawing. Its architect was James Craig (1744-95) who also designed Edinburgh's New Town. Today only the entrance, walls and a couple of minor buildings remain of the fort..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated October 7th 1820, but is not attributed to any artist, and may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This is one of several items relating to Loch Tay Priory which were collected or created by Hutton over a number of years. Priory Island is a small wooded island at the east end of Loch Tay, near to the outlet of the River Tay. The island is believed to have been the site of the death of Queen Sybilla, the consort of Alexander I of Scotland. The King is reputed to have granted the island to the monks of Scone Abbey in 1122, on the condition that a priory was erected there in Queen Sybilla's memory. After the Reformation in 1560, the remains of the priory were incorporated into a fortified home by a local landowner, Campbell of Glenorchy, and much of what remains today probably dates from the later building..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch depicts part of Edinburgh's Cowgate area, located in the heart of the Old Town section of the city. Although the exact section of the Cowgate represented in this sketch is unknown, it is likely to be somewhere very close to George IV Bridge. The name of the artist is not given, although it is likely that it was Hutton himself and no date has been included on the drawing. Running underneath George IV Bridge and the South Bridge, the Cowgate was the underworld of Edinburgh's Old Town. Located at the eastern end of the Grassmarket, the Cowgate was once the Irish Quarter, populated by the thousands of impoverished Irish immigrants who immigrated to Scotland during the Great Potato Famine of 1846-47. A rabbit warren of dark alleys and passageways, the Cowgate was formerly associated with poverty, crime and vice..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title below this drawing explains that this is a copy of a drawing, originally by Edward H. Columbine completed in 1792. This copy most likely dates from 1802, when many copies of his work appeared. The note goes on to explain the location of the stones, which are in close proximity to Stenness loch. The figures contained in the image adequately convey the fashion of the era. Hutton, the collector of these images and responsible for ordering this copy, was attempting to record the then current, state of Scotland’s pre-Reformation sites. Although this site is pre-Reformation, it is also not a Christian site and so its inclusion is quite unusual. It perhaps had pagan-ritual significance but this is open to wide interpretation. There are other ‘odd’ images of castles and monuments included so perhaps this site simply appealed to Hutton personally..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although this drawing dates from 20th October 1800, the modern skyline of Peebles is still recognisable. It is unsigned by the artist, but may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. Two notes to the right of the title read 'Cross Church' and 'Par. Ch'. These notes identify, the two spires shown in the picture. The ruined thirteenth-century Cross Church, in an elevated position north of the town centre, is the most obvious landmark. The rebuilt sixteenth-century High Street lies beyond that, south-east of the Eddleston Water, and the roofs of its buildings are discernible, culminating in the spire of the parish church which stands at its west end of the High Street. The hills behind the town are Preston Law, Hundleshope Heights and Stob Law..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1783, and is unsigned by the artist, but it is likely that this is one of George Henry Hutton's own works. Under the title that is written in ink, the words 'Gowrie Castle looking south' can be made out. The barracks at Perth was the subject of a series of drawings in the Hutton Collection, made in 1783. The drawing of this particular site were almost certainly all by Hutton: later engravings made of some of them name him as the artist. In the titles of all but two of the drawings, however, the barracks is named 'Gowrie Castle'. Gowrie Castle, or Gowrie House, situated on the west bank of the River Tay at the foot of South Sreet in Perth, was the town residence of the Ruthvens, Earls of Gowrie, until the seventeenth century when the family was forfeited by James VI, and its property removed. The building was converted into a barracks after the 1745-6 Jacobite Rising..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of a series of drawings in the Hutton Collection made at Perth Barracks in 1783. Although this drawing is unsigned, it was almost certainly the work of George Henry Hutton himself, who is named as the artist on engravings made in the early nineteenth century. In the titles of all but two of the series, however, the barracks is named Gowrie Castle. The baronial mansion which housed Perth Barracks in 1783 was originally the town residence of the Ruthvens, Earls of Gowrie. After an incident in 1600 when the third Earl and His brother was killed by James VI's attendants during an alleged assassination attempt on the King, the Ruthvens were forfeited and Gowrie House handed over to Perth burgh council. In 1746, after the Battle of Culloden, the council presented the house to the Duke of Cumberland, who promptly sold Gowrie House to the British Government so that it could be converted into barracks..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing may be by William Daniell, sketched during his island stay in 1818. There are a further two interior sketches attributed to him. The interior design of the Cathedral has always stirred interest amongst researchers due to the similarities with both Durham Cathedral and Dunfermline Abbey. The sophistication of the scheme also places Orkney in the heart of European fashion and political awareness. During the Cromwellian wars the English government built two forts at the harbour mouth, as Cromwell was worried about the strength of royalist support on the island. The town at this time, and until the reclamation of the Peerie Sea, enjoyed one long main axis road, with the area split into three districts – Burgh, Midtown and Laverock. The town also enjoyed the attentions of the aristocracy as many built fine town houses so they could winter over in relative comfort..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sciennes Convent, Edinburgh, from the south-west. The page, which reads, 14th July 1802, is unsigned by the artist, and may be the work of Hutton himself. In the background of the drawing is the village of Newington, now very much part of Edinburgh and beyond that is the familiar outline of Arthur's Seat. This is one of two views of Sciennes Convent in the Hutton Collection. The area in Edinburgh known as Sciennes may have taken its name from the medieval convent there, dedicated to St Catherine of Siena. The convent housed a community of Dominican nuns. Although it does not appear to have been one of Edinburgh's more significant ecclesiastical foundations, there is a reference to Sciennes Convent in Sir David Lindsay’s poem 'The Complaint of the Papingo'. The convent probably fell into disuse after the Reformation, and its stones helped build Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh, in 1602..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows the front view of Scone Palace, which is located in the village of Scone, near Perth. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been George Hutton himself. Overlooking the River Tay and the 'gateway to the Highlands', Scone Palace was originally the capital of Pictavia, and the crowning venue - using the Stone of Destiny - for new Scottish monarchs. As with so many Scottish buildings, the abbey of Scone and the Bishops' Palace were destroyed by a mob in 1559 during the Reformation. A new palace was subsequently built by the Gowrie family in 1580. However, following 'the Gowrie Conspiracy' against James VI of Scotland in 1600, the relieved King gifted the palace to Sir David Murray as a reward for his loyalty..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in 1781, depicts St Anthony's Chapel, which is located on the north side of Arthur's Seat in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh. The name of the artist is not included. Overlooking St Margaret's Loch, St Anthony's Chapel may date back to the mid-fifteenth century. Local legend has it that the chapel was associated with the Knights Hospitallers of St Anthony of Leith, and that it sat high up on Arthur's Seat so that they could see ships sailing up the River Forth. Apparently, a light in the tower welcomed seafarers. All that now remains are parts of the north and west walls, plus the nearby hermitage, which may have been a storeroom. 77.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil sketch of St Matthew's Collegiate Church, or Rosslyn Chapel, is one of two that depict features found at Rosslyn. The years 1400 to 1460 saw the growth in popularity of collegiate foundation in Scotland, collegiate indicating an ecclesiastical corporation. William Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Orkney, who also held land in this area, established St Matthew’s in 1446. Sinclair was more interested in quality than speed and as a result, when he passed away in 1482, the church was far from complete. Originally intended to be a large cruciform church with a central tower, only the choir, east transept walls and the nave foundations were ever completed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title along the bottom of the sheet reveals that William Daniell drew this sketch of the standing stones at Stenness, probably in 1818. The stones have been set in the context of their mountainous surroundings, and a figure gives perspective. There are another three views of the Stenness stones contained in the Hutton Drawings. William Daniell is more famous for his images of some of the more remote areas of India. His Uncle, Thomas, and Daniell travelled around India in the late 1800s visiting places, which were considered 'uncivilised’. As a result, their powerful representations caused much comment when they returned to this country. There are other sketches in the Hutton Drawings by William Daniell but they are of other Scottish locations. All together, they stand as a testament to Daniell’s skill in depicting his native landscape..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing was by a J. Mc [?], the rest of the name now being lost. It may date from 1807. This picture, although labelled Stenness, may actually be a representation of the Ring of Brodgar, further along the same track. The standing stones at Stenness reach 5.6 metres in height, although only four of the original 12 remain standing. Excavators discovered grooved ware pottery on the site in 1973. The Stenness circle is near the larger and more well-known Ring of Brodgar, although this larger henge may be slightly younger. There is no clear indication of who used the circle or why but it has now gained the nickname 'the lunar circle'. ircle was used but it has now gained the nickname ‘the lunar circle’..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is the only drawing or sketch of this site in the Hutton Collection, and as it does not carry the name of any artist, it is likely to be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. Beneath the title, a handwritten note gives a brief description of the location and appearance of the chapel. Today the chapel in Cromarty dedicated to St Regulus has almost completely disappeared except for the foundations, but more substantial remains existed in Hutton's day, and are described in the memoirs of the nineteenth century geologist, preacher and author Hugh Miller, who was born in Cromarty. St Regulus is reputed to have arrived in Scotland around AD 345, and Cromarty is believed to have had a church from about the sixth century, but it is not known whether this church was the chapel of St Regulus. The legacy of St Regulus lives on in an Episcopal church bearing his name in modern Cromarty..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows Linlithgow Palace as viewed from the east. The arch-shaped entrance door in the middle of the drawing would once have been the main entrance to the palace, and a drawbridge would have been located in front of it. Although the palace is now a ruin, you can still see the ornate stonework above this entrance door. The name of the artist is not included. Linlithgow Palace has been a royal residence since the twelfth century. Although there was probably a royal manor-house on this site during the 1100s, it was not until Edward I of England built around the existing buildings in 1301 that a royal pedigree was established. However, David II destroyed Edward's buildings following the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The ruined palace buildings seen today were built for James I of Scotland in 1425. The Scottish Parliament was also held here on several occasions..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, made in October 1820, shows the island in Loch Tay as viewed from the east side of the loch, on the old stone bridge next to the village of Kenmore. Looking very closely at the clump of trees on the island, it is possible to discern the vague remains of some building - possibly the remnants of a priory or a fort. Below the title is a note in brackets which reads, 'Drawn from the North end of the Bridge. The name of the artist is not included. Also known as the Isle of Loch Tay, Priory Island was gifted by Alexander I to the monks of Scone Abbey in 1122, after his wife, Queen Sybilla, died on the island - so it is reputed. It is not clear if the ruins on the island are that of an ancient priory or a fort. It is recorded that the Campbells of Glenorchy built a fort on the island during the sixteenth century, with some of the ruins still remaining. This area of Loch Tay is especially famous for its crannogs..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This detailed drawing shows the east window of Dunblane Cathedral. A note in the bottom right-hand corner reads, 'Elevation of the E window Dunblane cathedral'. Although there is no artist and date attached, it may be the work of Alexander Morton and may date from around 1813. Alexander Morton executed a large number of the drawings that form the Hutton Collection in the 1810s. He is renowned for his floor plans of ecclesiastical buildings, many of which are in the Hutton Collection. If this drawing is indeed by him, it is an unusual and interesting example of his work..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Elevation of the standing stones at Stenness, Orkney. Edward H. Columbine completed the original drawing in 1792 and then it was copied, probably at Hutton's request in 1802. It captures the suddenness of this feature in the landscape admirably, as the visitor can find the situation of the stones quite arresting. There is another three views of Stenness in the Hutton Drawings, one of is a copy of another of Captain Columbine’s composition. Columbine’s career can be a little difficult to piece together in places. It is known that he work as a hydrographer and captain for the Office of the Admiralty. These drawings, of which there are many copies in the Hutton Drawings, help fill in some of the blanks. He completed many drawings of Orkney and Shetland in 1792 suggesting that he spent at least a season in the north of Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 19th September 1819, and although not attributed to any artist, is most likely the work of George Henry Hutton himself. The extensive description beneath the title was copied, probably by Hutton, from notes made by a local man named Hugh Ross. This is one of at least nine items relating to Fearn in the Hutton Collection. Ferquhard MacTaggart, called in Scots Gaelic 'Farquhar O'Beolan, Mac an t'Sagairt', was the first Earl of Ross, and is believed to have lived from about 1195 to 1256. He founded Fearn Abbey, dedicated to St Ninian, for the Premonstratensian Order of monks in 1227. In around 1246, the abbey was moved a few miles inland from its original site on the south shore of the Dornoch Firth, to its present location, where Earl Ferquhard was buried after his death..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Interior of St Duthac's Collegiate Church in Tain, Ross-shire. It is dated September 2nd 1819. The page is unsigned by the artist, and it is likely that George Henry Hutton himself made the drawing. Despite not being one of Scotland's most celebrated ecclesiastical buildings, St Duthac's Collegiate Church clearly held a lot of interest for Hutton, and there are at least ten items relating to it in his collection of drawings. This detailed drawing provides an excellent impression of the layout of St Duthac's Collegiate Church. The pulpit is on the right hand side, and much of the space for worshippers in the narrow church appears to be concentrated in split-level galleries. In this drawing the church seems to be intact and in good condition, but it is known that it fell into disrepair some time early in the nineteenth century, and had to be re-roofed and restored in 1877..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>William Daniell drew this sketch, of the interior of St Magnus’ Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney, probably in 1818, when he visited the island. Daniell went on to record another two interior sketches and all together there are eight views of the Cathedral to be found in the Hutton Drawings. There has been much speculation over the origins of the architects and masons responsible for the work carried out at the Cathedral. There appear to be strong similarities between the work at Durham Cathedral and Dunfermline Abbey and the architecture in evidence on Orkney. The Cathedral commemorates Earl Rognvald's, martyred uncle, St Magnus. This link was always tenuous but excavations in 1919 discovered a skull high up in the structure of the wall. The skull had split in two, which is the reported manner of Magnus’ death!.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1783 but is unsigned by the artist. This is one of several images relating to the Gowrie House in the Hutton Collection. In each title, its name is 'Gowrie Castle', although the building was a baronial mansion rather than a castle, and went by the name 'Gowrie House'. Situated on the banks of the Tay in the centre of Perth, Gowrie House was the town residence of the Earls of Gowrie, who also owned nearby Ruthven Castle (now Huntingtower Castle). In the seventeenth century the town assumed ownership of Gowrie House, which was demolished in 1809 having served latterly as a military barracks..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated September 25th, 1819, but is unsigned by the artist. The drawing could be the work of James Shand, who was responsible for several views of St Duthac's Collegiate Church in the Hutton Collection, but is it is more likely to be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. St Duthac's Collegiate Church, which was built in 1360, is the most modern of three buildings dedicated to St Duthac in the Ross-shire town of Tain, where Duthac or Duthus is reputed to have been born about 1000. The earliest is a small twelfth-century chapel a few yards south-east the church, which has been derelict since being damaged by fire in 1427. In the north of the town, on a knoll overlooking the Dornoch Firth, is another chapel which was reputedly built to house the relics of St Duthac when they were returned to the town from Ireland, about 1253. These are the three oldest surviving buildings in Tain, although only the collegiate church remains intact..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, made in July 1789, shows the island in Loch Tay as viewed from the south side of the loch, next to the village of Kenmore. Looking closely at the island, it is possible to see the remains of buildings. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been George Hutton himself. The island in this sketch is known as Priory Island and also as Eilean Nam Ban, Sybilla's Island or the Isle Of Loch Tay. The island was gifted by Alexander I of Scotland to the monks of Scone Abbey in 1122, as the burial place of his wife, Queen Sybilla. A fort was built on the island during the sixteenth century by the Campbells of Glenorchy, with some of the ruins still standing. This section of Loch Tay is famous for its crannogs (ancient lake dwellings)..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, of St Magnus' Cathedral in Orkney, may be by William Daniell in about 1818. The cruciform shape, rising in levels to the tower is clear in this image. This is one of eight views of the cathedral held in the Hutton Drawings. Daniell, a well-known artist of his day, completed many sketches and drawings of Scottish sites of importance, many of which are now in the Hutton Drawings. He is more famous for his English and Indian landscapes and so these items are a refreshing testament to his skill in representing this countries landscape. How he became involved in adding to Hutton’s Scottish ecclesiastical record, however, is unclear..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, made in June 1807, shows the north-east view of Torphichen Preceptory, which is located in the West Lothian village of Torphichen. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. St Ninian established the first church to exist at this site in about 400. King Arthur supposedly visited in 516. King David I of Scotland, meanwhile, founded Torphichen Preceptory, in 1153. The preceptory was the Scottish seat of the Knights Hospitallers or Knights of St John of Jerusalem. The nave, transept and choir date from the thirteenth century, and traces of them still exist. However, very little now remains of the cloister and the domestic buildings, while the preceptory was much altered during the fifteenth century, while the parish church at this site was built in 1756..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, drawn in 1781, shows the ruins of Fala Luggie Tower, which is located on Fala Moor, close to the village of Fala, in Midlothian. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. While known as Fala 'Tower', this building is likely to be the ruins of a twelfth-century monastery. Built by monks of the Augustinian Order, this monastery was the highest in Britain, at 370 metres above sea level. Built on the site of an ancient Roman road, the monastery was located beside what was then the main land route into Scotland. Fala Tower is mentioned in verse eight (canto IV) of Sir Walter Scott's epic poem, 'The Lay of the Last Minstrel'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of the remains of Soutra Hospital (or Holy Trinity Hospital of Soutra), now known as Soutra Aisle. is dated 1784 but is unsigned by the artist. This is the only drawing of Soutra Hospital in the Hutton Collection. The remains of the twelfth-century hospital at Soutra are located on a high plain about 12 miles south of Dalkeith in Midlothian. The hospital, which was inhabited by Augustinian monks, provided shelter and assistance for the poor and for people travelling between Edinburgh and the borders, as well as medical care for the sick. Soutra may have been the largest medieval hospital in Scotland. Archaeological excavations of the site in the late twentieth century yielded important information on the types of natural remedies used by the monks..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dated 1783, depicts the Old Bridge over the River Tay at Perth, as viewed from the east bank and looking south. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been George Hutton himself. The artist who made this drawing would have been standing upriver, looking down towards the bridge, with the city of Perth clearly visible on the right side of the drawing. Indeed, the spire of St John's Church is quite visible to the right of the bridge. Also known as Smeaton's Bridge, the Old Bridge, was built in 1771. It replaced the ferry that had been operating for 150 years - the original bridge having been destroyed in a flood in 1621. The bridge was named after the engineer who built it, John Smeaton, and took four years to construct at a cost of £26,631 - about £2,129,000 in today's terms..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This untitled drawing shows the ruins of Sciennes Convent in Edinburgh. The page is undated and the drawing is unsigned by the artist. This is one of two views of Sciennes Convent in the Hutton Collection. As the capital and largest city in medieval Scotland, Edinburgh contained many religious foundations. Sciennes Convent appears to have been one of the less prominent ecclesiastical buildings. Located to the south-east of Edinburgh city centre, it housed an order of Dominican nuns. The name Sciennes may derive from St Catherine of Sienna, after whom the convent took its name..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, which is dated 1796, does not carry the name of the artist, and may be one of George Henry Hutton's own works. This is one of eight views of Peebles Cross Church in the Hutton Collection. Many of the images in the Hutton Collection are quite rough sketches, but the fine detail of this suggests the high level of artisanship that was involved in carving the stones for this arched doorway. Arched doorways and windows were particularly popular features of important medieval buildings. The pointed arch, like the type shown here, was the most identifiable feature of the Gothic period of medieval architecture, and began to replace rounded Romanesque arches in Britain in the twelfth century. Peebles Cross Church, founded in 1261, dates from a little later in the Gothic period..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is one of several different studies of St Duthac's Collegiate Church by James Shand in the Hutton Collection, and is dated September 20th 1815. Tain is thought to be one of the oldest continuous human settlements in Scotland, its name signifying that it may have been the site of a Norse council or parliament. St Duthac, or St Duthus, is reputed to have been born in the town about 1000, and although he died in Ireland, his relics were returned to Tain in 1253, and a small chapel was built near the seashore to house them. Another church dedicated to St Duthac was built in 1360 in the centre of Tain, and became St Duthac's Collegiate Church in 1487..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, although unsigned, is dated 1818 and it is one of seven views of the Cathedral held in the Hutton Drawings. The ruins of the Earl's Palace are on the left. Today the modern town centre surrounds both these buildings and the panorama is very different. Rognvald the Earl of Norway founded St Magnus’ Cathedral, the most northern in Great Britain, in 1137. It commemorates the Earl's uncle, Magnus, who had died a martyr in 1117. It stood on a prime piece of shore land, just as much of Kirkwall now sits on reclaimed land, and was an expression of the new Earl’s power. Rognvald, a usurper to his title, attempted to use the building to win support amongst Orkney’s aristocracy..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>It is likely that this detailed pencil drawing was made by George Henry Hutton, although it is unsigned. The Hutton Collection contains several drawings of this abbey. The thirteenth-century ruins of Inchaffray Abbey are situated six miles east of Crieff, in what is now the region of Perth and Kinross. The name is derived from the Gaelic, 'Innisabh-reidh', which means 'island of the smooth water'. This is because originally the abbey stood on an island in the centre of a lake which was famous for its eels. The lake has long-since dried up..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the Tron Church, which is located on the Royal Mile, at the junction with North and South Bridges. The name of the artist is not included. It may depict the rebuilding work after both side aisles were removed between 1785 and 1787 during the building of the South Bridge. Named after a salt-tron, which was a public weighing beam, King Charles I founded the Tron Kirk in 1637. The original wooden spire burnt down in 1824, and the church itself closed in 1952, though the building remains open as tourist attraction..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. This drawing is dated 19th October 1815, and is one of at least nine images relating to Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection, most of which date from 1815. It is likely that this is one of George Henry Hutton's own drawings, as no artist is credited on the page. This drawing of the west end of Fortrose Cathedral shows a largely intact western façade containing a gothic-arched double window, and an ornate door. It is likely that this was the main entrance to the cathedral. It was customary in medieval British ecclesiastical buildings for the entrance to be at the opposite end from the altar, which Mosaic law dictated should be in the east. The gothic arch is a distinctive marker of medieval Christian religious buildings from the start of the twelfth century onwards..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1789, but is not attributed to any artist, and may be one of George Henry Hutton's own drawings. This is the only image relating to Tullibardine in the Hutton Collection, and shows the medieval church among trees in the middle ground, while the tower house of Tullibardine Castle is to the right of the church in the distance. Tullibardine Collegiate Church lies just outside the village of Tullibardine, approximately six miles south-east of Crieff. It was founded in 1446 by Sir David Murray of Tullibardine, an ancestor of the Dukes of Atholl. In the year of its foundation the church also became the last resting place of Sir David, who died shortly after building had begun. The ruins of the Castle were demolished around 1833..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sheet contains detailed drawings of the east and west elevations of St Duthac's Collegiate Church, which were drawn by James Shand. Shand was responsible for two ground-plans and a number of architectural drawings of this site in the Hutton Collection. The drawings on this page were made on September 20th, 1815. Shand's drawings appear to show two doors in each of the two facades, leading to different levels in the church. Quite unusually for a medieval foundation, the main entrance to St Duthac's is towards the south. St Duthac's was built in 1360, and in ecclesiastical buildings of that age it was more common for the entrance to be at the west end of the church or chapel, opposite the altar, which Mosaic law dictated should be built in the east..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This ground-plan is by Mr James Shand, and dated 1815. Shand was responsible for two plans of Fearn Abbey in the Hutton Collection, both originating in the same year. This is the less heavily annotated of the two, and appears to be more concerned with a general description of the abbey and its surroundings than with the dimensions and locations of individual details in the building. George Henry Hutton appears to have been very interested in Fearn Abbey, accumulating at least nine different items relating to the site in his antiquarian researches. Although today it is not one of the better known monastic sites in Scotland, Fearn has a fascinating and sometimes macabre history, which includes a strong association with Patrick Hamilton, Scotland's first Protestant martyr, and a structural collapse in 1742, which caused many fatalities and was apparently prophesied by the Brahan Seer..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was made by James Shand and is one of two plans of the church by this draughtsman in the Hutton Collection. This plan, dated 1815, is the earlier of the two, the other having been made in 1819. Shand's plans of St Duthac's Collegiate Church are just two of quite a number of items relating to Tain in the Hutton Collection. This ground-plan is produced in finer detail than some of the plans of other sites in the Hutton Collection, which comprise little more than a rough outline and some approximate dimensions. Shand's work, by contrast, is annotated with a list of references, which identify and describe highlighted features on the ground plan, such as doors, windows, sets of stairs and the pulpit..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>These elevations are depictions of the cathedral of St Magnus on Orkney. Although they have no draughtsman’s name attached, James Stewart communicated them to Hutton in 1789. There are a further seven views of the Abbey held in the Hutton Drawings. Work on the Cathedral started in 1137, the project being an attempt to win the islanders over. Earl Rognvald the patron had usurped the title from Earl Paul and had him killed on the mainland in Caithness. Rognvald's had already spent most of his finances on his campaign and so the building work progressed slowly. Eventually he had to yield some of his rights to Orkney's tenant farmers, in return for payment. This allowed the work to be completed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no general title included on this sheet. The first drawing says, 'Elevation of Old Carmelite Church - South Queensferry by Mr Alex. Morton'. The second reads, 'Perspective view of the Carmelite Church / South-Queensferry from S.E'. This is one of two architectural drawings made of this building by Alexander Morton, the other being dated 1813. Morton was a prolific recorder of ecclesiastical monuments in this area. George Dundas established this Carmelite house in 1330. It was not until his descendant James Dundas, in 1440, gifted this site and the surrounding lands to the house, however, that they gained a permanent home and source of wealth. The Dundas family dedicated the House to the Virgin Mary, the order's patron, in order to pray for the family. It would have formed a vital and important stage of the pilgrimage to St Andrews and Dunfermline Abbey..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Made in 1811, this engraved plan of Edinburgh provides a glimpse of the city's layout during the late-Georgian era. The well-structured layout of the Georgian New Town, north of Princes Street, contrasts notably with the relative chaos of the Old Town in the area to the east of the castle. The fact that Leith and Portobello are separate places also stands out. Thomas Bonnar drew, and J. Craig engraved, the plan..</dc:description>

The Collection also includes another Hutton drawing of Gowrie House, which dates from 1783, one of a series of studies Hutton made of the building. The house, which overlooked the Tay in the centre of Perth, disappeared in 1809. It had been the town residence of the Earls of Gowrie until the early seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note under the left hand side of the engraving reads, 'Drawn by Genl. Hutton for the Portfolio, &amp; Engd. by J. &amp; H. Storer'. On the right hand side a note reads, 'Pubd. by Sherwood &amp; Co, Augt. 1, 1823'. The engravers, James Sargant Storer and Henry Sargant Storer, father and son, were leaders in their field, and appear to have produced a great deal of work for a publication by Sherwood called 'The Portfolio' around this time. The Hutton Collection contains several images of Gowrie House, mostly unsigned drawings dated about 1783. It is likely that Hutton drew these and the original drawing from which this engraving came at the same time. Gowrie House was demolished in 1809, which means that the drawing must have predated the 1823 publication of the portfolio, and the soldiers and artillery depicted here suggest a 1783 origin, as Gowrie House served as a military barracks at this time..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving shows a view of Perth, as viewed from Wood End. A note on the lower left-hand side names the engraver as A. Robertson. It is also inscribed to Lady Charlotte Murray by Alexander Murray. No date has been included. This engraving certainly represents Perth as a busy place, with a number of small merchant ships visible on the River Tay, and men working in the field in the foreground. The Old Bridge, also known as Smeaton's Bridge, can be seen on the right of the engraving, while the spire of St John's Kirk dominates the city's skyline. In short, the engraving is very much a mixture of urban and rural landscapes - an accurate reflection of Perth's hybrid identity..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan is dated 1815, and is attributed to James Shand, who was also responsible for another plan of the building in the Hutton Collection. In his note under the title, Shand goes on to explain that the parish church incorporates the remains of the medieval Abbey of Fearn This is the more detailed of Shand's two ground-plans of Fearn Abbey. A scale of feet is included, and individual details in the construction of the building, such as gothic windows, are tagged with letters and explained in an extensive key at the foot of the page. Shand has also developed a system of different shadings to indicate which parts of the drawn outline represent complete walls, incomplete walls or foundations..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was 'drawn 8th June 1826'. It is signed by William MacGregor Stirling, Parish minister at Port of Menteith, who made several drawings of Inchmahome Priory for Hutton. A note by Stirling above his signature reads: 'To Lieutenant General Henry Hutton This sketch of the present state of the priory of Inchmahome (drawn from pacing only, but with a minute attention to existing phenomena)'. The details and 'existing phenomena' noted by Stirling include the approximate dimensions of the building in paces, the state of repair of walls, windows, doors and arches, the locations of the different rooms in the priory complex, and the locations of tombs and identities of those interred within them..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This incomplete sketch is of the interior of Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. As it does not carry the name of the artist, it is likely that this was one of George Henry Hutton's own drawings. There are at least nine images relating to Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection, and most, like this example, date from 1815. The interior part of Fortrose Cathedral shown by this sketch appears to contain an arched monument. There are three such monuments in the ruins of Fortrose Cathedral. All that remains of the building today is part of the south aisle, part of the chapter house and its vaulted undercroft, and the chapel, although the foundations of the rest of the complex are clearly visible in the cathedral grounds. It is likely that the cathedral was in a similar state of disrepair in Hutton's time, as it had fallen into disuse by the seventeenth century, and was largely dismantled by Cromwellian soldiers and locals seeking building stone..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated June 1790, and may be the work of Francis Grose, an author, antiquary and artist who was responsible for a number of drawings in the Hutton Collection. There are no annotations on the page to suggest what the monument might represent, or whom it might commemorate. 'Hunting Tower', or Huntingtower Castle, is the modern name for Ruthven Castle, the country seat of the Ruthven family, who held the Earldom of Gowrie until their titles and lands were forfeited by James VI in the early seventeenth century. The castle passed to the ownership of the crown and was renamed Huntingtower. The restored castle is today a well-known landmark on the western outskirts of Perth..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Notes relating to the remains of a monastery or priory on Loch Tay, dated October 7th 1820. Although the page is unsigned, the notes appear to be in George Henry Hutton's handwriting. Hutton collected a number of images and other pieces of information relating to the ruined ecclesiastical foundation on Priory Island in Loch Tay. The notes shown here begin: 'The Ruins, consisting of four Apartments, are extremely plain and do not appear to be very old. The largest apartment (the second from the East) has been lighted by windows on both the North &amp; South sides, &amp; is supposed to have been the Chapel, in the N.W. angle of which human bones have been found.' The author continues by explaining that Priory Island is reputed to have been the last resting place of Queen Sybilla, the wife of Alexander I of Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Notes to annotated ground-plan of Fortrose Cathedral, Ross-shire. It is the second page of a plan of Fortrose Cathedral in the Hutton Collection drawn by John McQueen. The page is a continuation of a list of references begun on the previous page. The numbers and letters to which the different paragraphs refer denote parts of the cathedral marked on the ground-plans on the previous page. The top section of this page, consisting of six sets of figures, numbered one to six, gives the measurements of the different windows in Fortrose Cathedral. The bottom section, which is numbered 'f' to 'n' in the margin, describes some of the subtler physical features of the cathedral, such as carved niches and hollows in the walls, and stonework of different ages..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alexander Morton, who drew many plans of Scottish church buildings during the early 1800s, made this plan of Crichton Collegiate Church, Gorebridge, Midlothian, in May 1817. The Roman numerals included on the plan correspond with the numbered list on the left side of the drawing, and indicate the rooms and main areas of the building. The exact dimensions of each room and area are also included on the drawing. William Crichton, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, founded Crichton Collegiate Church in 1449. Located near the ruins of Crichton Castle, by the village of Crichton, the church is in the memory of St Mary, St Mungo and St Kentigern. Unusually, the church had no nave. The church returned to its former splendour in 1898..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sheet is a copy of a sketch of St Mary's Church, Banff, by the Reverend J. Cordiner. It is not dated but from the appearance of the church, Cordiner probably drew the original before 1797. In this year, large parts of the church in Cordiner's sketch were considered dangerous and so pulled down. The south aisle remained intact. The Hutton Collection contains three other views of St Mary's Church in Banff, one of which, by William Hay from 1815, shows the church after demolition. St Mary's Church dates from 1471. It stood close to the mouth of the River Deveron, to the south-east of the old castle of Banff and east of the town's medieval market-place. Structurally, the main body of the church was a simple rectangle, but a short vaulted aisle extended from the south wall of the church, and was the burial place of the Ogilvie family of Banff, a local branch of a prominent Scots noble family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing and a description of Oronsay Priory, Argyllshire, is a copy of a description and illustration of the priory of Oronsay in Thomas Pennant's 'A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides', published in 1774-6. The description begins on the reverse of the sheet, The first priory on Oronsay is believed to have been founded in AD 563 by the Celtic saint Oran, after whom the island is named. The priory re-established, in about 1340, for an order of Augustinian monks, by one of the Lords of the Isles. Although abandoned after the Reformation of 1560, substantial parts of the priory and its grounds remain almost intact. The most remarkable relic of the priory is the fifteenth-century Oronsay Cross, which stands within the grounds, engraved with Romano-Celtic designs and an image of Christ. Other stones carved with Celtic designs are also in the priory grounds..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Detail from Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. This rubbing was taken from a stone in Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. A note at the bottom left-hand corner reads, 'Inscription at the West end of the Col. Ch. Of Seton - 29 Sept 1802. Ave Maria?' Whilst it is very difficult to see any inscription in this particular rubbing, the artist has suggested it reads 'Ave Maria'. The Hutton Collection includes a number of other drawings and plans relating to Seton Collegiate Church. These range from an external view of the church to sketches of armorial bearings, decorative details and tombstones. Unlike many of the other churches and abbeys, Seton Collegiate Church has survived the ravages of time and remains largely intact..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Untitled drawing showing a large bell that belonged to Holywood Abbey, three miles north of Dumfries, in Dumfriesshire. Although the identity of the artist is unknown, it is likely that it was Hutton himself. The drawing dates from around 1811. There were two surviving bells from the abbey, and they are still in the local parish church. The Hutton Collection also contains a drawing of this other bell. Built in an English Gothic style, Holywood Abbey dates back to around 1180. Before the abbey, however, the site appears to have been the home of a monk called Congall. Indeed, 'the oak wood of Congall' is one of the early names for the site where the abbey is located. Premonstratensians inhabited the now ruined Abbey. This Order, which was a mixture of the monastic and canonical, originally came from Laon in France..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was drawn by Alexander Morton in 1817; It shows a detailed plan of the interior of Dunbar Collegiate Church. Morton has included a numerical key highlighting the different areas of the church, along with individual measurements and a scale. Two years after Alexander Morton drew these plans, the construction of Dunbar Parish Church commenced on the site of the old Collegiate Church. Morton's plan, therefore, offers an insight into the interior of an important ecclesiastical building that no longer exists. Founded in the early fourteenth century, Dunbar Collegiate Church was the first Collegiate Church in the Lothians, if not in the whole of Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>John Gilleson made this plan of Dunglass Collegiate Church in 1822. Each room and area of the church has a detailed description of its history and general layout. Although there is some argument over the founder of the Collegiate Church at Dunglass, most historians now consider that it was due to the generosity of Sir Alexander Hume of Hume or Home. It is likely that the tower and choir date from 1450, with the nave being added a short time later. Although the Pope gave permission to convert Dunglass into a collegiate church, this never happened..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketched plan of Elgin Cathedral, Moray 'by Mr P. Duff, Dec 1815'. This is probably Patrick Duff, who published 'Sketch of the Geology of Moray', in 1842. He has included a table at the bottom that gives the areas of different parts of the cathedral in square links. The Hutton Collection contains a number of other drawings of Elgin Cathedral. Elgin Cathedral, dating from 1244, was the seat of the Bishops of Moray. It stands on a site dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It had a turbulent history, including torching by the 'Wolf of Badenoch', Alexander Stewart, in 1390, as retribution for the then bishop's excommunication of him. It was restored but fell into disrepair after the Reformation and was only saved from total ruin when, eventually, the Government began maintaining it as a monument..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan is signed 'Mr ___ Allan' and is dated 1805. There is a similar plan, dating from 1789, by W. Whyte. The reference key to the right of the drawing gives a good idea of the original uses the Cistercian monks made of the buildings at Deer Abbey, which they would have long since abandoned at the time this plan was drawn. As well as the usual ecclesiastical buildings such as 'The Kirk', and the 'Monk's Cells', there was a kiln, offices, a mill and a lodge for the porter, or caretaker..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows an inscription that appears on a cross or headstone in the graveyard at Kilkerran Church in Campbeltown, Argyllshire. A note at the top of the page dates the drawing from August 1802, and says that, 'Two small fragments only remain of the church'. At the foot of the page, the artist adds that the names 'McEacherne' and 'McEachern' appear frequently. The old Kilkerran Cemetery is located just outside of Campbeltown, on the foot of the Mull of Kintyre peninsula. The church and graveyard commemorates St Ciaran, an Irish missionary and a friend of St Columba, who came to Kintyre during the sixth century. The cemetery was a royal burial ground, with many of the Kings of Dalriada interred here. The ruins of the church were still visible until around 1870..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Detail from Ardchattan Priory, Argyllshire, again dated September 1820, and including measurements for the width and length. It has six carved figures, male and female, in decorative niches, and a Latin inscription around the edge. The artist has also included the note 'The inscription communicated by Gen. Campbell in 1803'. Founded in the thirteenth century by Duncan MacDougall, Ardchattan Priory was one of three houses in Scotland belonging to the Valliscaulian Order; the other two being Pluscarden and Beauly. Whilst King Alexander II founded Pluscarden, laymen founded Beauly and Ardchattan. Monks remained at Ardchattan until the mid-sixteenth century, after which the priory and its lands belonged to the Campbell family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing from Luffness Friary, East Lothian. This drawing shows the remains of a damaged tombstone in the ruins of Luffness Friary, near Aberlady. The artist has included inscriptions and much of the decorative detail on the stone. Although a date has not been included, it was probably drawn in 1802 - the same year 'Bickerton's Tomb' was sketched. The Hutton Collection includes the rough sketch and drawing of 'Bickerton's Tomb', which lies close to the remains of the high altar in the north-east corner of the monastery. It is said to be the resting place of the monastery's founder, Sir David de Lindsay, who presented the land to the Carmelites in the thirteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Colour wash drawing of a ‘church’ at Iona, 'from a sketch by Capt. Columbine'. The ‘church’ may be unnamed but it looks like the Abbey tower. Captain Columbine worked in the area and drew other Iona monuments in 1792. There are nine views of Iona in the Hutton Collection. Edward Henry Columbine (c.1760-1811), worked in the Royal Navy between 1790 and 1803, mainly as a hydrographer, eventually attaining the ranks of Lieutenant and then Captain. During his career, he was involved in official Board of Admiralty investigations. Although charged with the loss of the ship the Soleby, he won an acquittal and went on to complete major surveys along the west coast of Africa. He died travelling home from Africa, of a fever, in June 1811..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Colour drawing of Beauly panorama, Ross-shire. A note explains that the view of the priory is largely obscured by Fraser of Lovat's new store house and that the drawing was completed looking out of the window. Beauly Priory is visible in the distance, across the bay. Beauly Priory sits at the heart of Beauly town. This sheet alludes to the new building work by Mr Fraser of Lovat and thirty-eight years later, the Baron of Lovat laid out a new town square around the priory. So for its importance to the local community, time has not stood still in this flourishing northern town..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was drawn by Alexander Morton in 1817, and shows Yester Church. Morton has included a compass and scale, along with individual measurements and a brief reference highlighting significant areas of the interior. Morton's plan is most likely of Yester Chapel, which is in the grounds of Yester House, near Gifford, East Lothian. Previously known as the Collegiate Church of St Cuthbert, Yester Chapel was the local place of worship until a new parish church was built in Gifford in the early-eighteenth century. Following this move, the Hay family had the Adam brothers remodel the chapel's exterior and used it as a family chapel and mausoleum..</dc:description>

Saddell Abbey covers a wide area, up to Saddell Water, represented by the blue in the picture. Somerled, King of the Isles, and St Malachy of Mellifont, Ireland, who was on his way to Rome founded Saddell Abbey in 1148. Somerled’s son, Reginald, completed the establishment of this Cistercian house when he came to power. The Irish influence of the original monks is visible in the Celtic symbolism present in the stone carvings..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of a stone from Ardchattan Priory, Argyllshire, dated September 1820, and including measurements. The stone has inscriptions and a carved figure in an attitude of prayer. A note underneath the titles suggests that the stone is not in its original location. Duncan MacDougall founded Ardchattan in 1231. Dedicated to St Mary and John the Baptist, it was one of three houses in Scotland belonging to the Valliscaulian Order: the other two being Beauly and Pluscarden. Located in a sheltered spot on the banks of Loch Etive, near Oban, Argyllshire, the monks famously cultivated a beautiful garden in the grounds of the priory..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This painting shows the ruins of the thirteenth-century Abbey of St Mary of Deer and is one of a series of drawings in the Hutton Collection that show different views of the abbey. An unknown artist dates it 7th March 1796. There is another similar drawing in the Hutton Collection, likely by the same artist, of the same view, dated 1819. Deer Abbey is in Aberdeenshire, about one mile from the village of Old Deer and one and a half miles from Mintlaw in the north-east of Scotland. The monks at Deer were Cistercians, called 'white monks' because of the long white robes they wore. The abbey fell into disrepair when it was abandoned in the seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A scale, in chains and links, has been included below the title in this plan, and there is a key at the bottom left, denoting the uses for various buildings. W. Whyte, author of the plan, has signed his name in the bottom right corner. The Hutton Collection contains a similar plan, dating from 1805, by 'Mr ___ Allan'. At the time of this survey, the monks would have abandoned the abbey. It is clear from this plan that the community was well-organised. As well as the usual ecclesiastical buildings, there was a school, a mill, and note 'f' reads, 'a lead pipe was found in this Direction', which suggests they had some form of water supply in place..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sheet does not carry a title, but contains sketches of two heraldic symbols, each accompanied by explanatory notes. Beneath the drawings, Hutton has added a note, which reads: 'Recd. (2d Decr. 1820) from Mr William Mitchell, Mason, Coupar Angus, with his plan of the abbey'. In another drawing in his collection, Hutton has referred to the same man as Mr John Mitchell, so doubt remains over which was his name. The notes that accompany these sketches are not clear, but the top sketch appears to be a coat of arms that belonged to the Campbell family, who were Dukes of Greenock. It says that the Campbell's title and coats of arms have subsequently altered. The engravings may have been included in the abbey's masonry as dedications to people and families that had been benefactors of the Coupar Cistercians..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan, of St Mary's Priory, North Berwick, was drawn by Alexander Morton in 1817. It details the interior of St Mary's Priory. Morton has not only recorded individual measurements on his plan, but has also included a compass and scale. A handwritten note above the title is difficult to decipher. St Mary's Priory has had a long and colourful history dating back to its foundation in the twelfth century. Pillaged during the turbulent reign of King James III (1452-88), order was restored for a number of years before the nunnery was again pillaged and burnt in 1529. It is interesting to note that the devastation in 1529 occurred around thirty years before the Reformation had reached Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Annotated ground plan of Beauly Priory, Inverness-shire. The title of this plan appears to be 'Dimensions of the Coll. Church of Beaulieu', although there was no collegiate church in Beauly. It is likely that the plan is of Beauly Priory, which features in a number of other drawings and sketches in the Hutton Collection. Someone appears to have written the annotations slightly later, in a firmer hand and obscuring parts of the plan of the priory. The artist's surname is given as Hogg, and the plan is dated 1815. Today most of the thirteenth-century Beauly Priory is in an advanced state of ruin. The priory originally housed Valliscaulian monks, but in 1510 changed its adherence and adopted Cistercian principles. After the Reformation of 1560, it fell into disuse, and became merely a source of materials for other buildings in the village of Beauly. The north transept, rebuilt in 1901 as a mausoleum for the Mackenzie family, remains intact today..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of the west façade of St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen, from a sketch by the Rev. J. Cordiner. It is not dated. The Hutton Collection also contains another sketch of the west façade of St Machar's Cathedral, by Mr G. Smith. These are two of a number of different perspectives of the interior and exterior of the cathedral collected by George Henry Hutton. Cordiner's sketch reveals more of the detail of the cathedral's west façade than Smith’s does, where cottages and trees in the foreground obscure much of the building. As was traditional in medieval church foundations, the main entrance to the cathedral is in the west wall, and above the doors, instead of one large window, the stonemason has constructed seven narrow, candle-shaped windows known as 'lights'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The plan of Gullane Church was drawn in 1817. The plan of Dunbar Friary is entitled 'Remains of the Monastery of Friars at Dunbar' and is dated 1816. Both are by Alexander Morton and include compasses, scales and various measurements. A large number of the plans that form part of the Hutton Collection were drawn by Alexander Morton in the 1810s. Little appears to be known about him. It is possible he lived or had offices in Dunfermline as he often wrote the name of the town alongside his signature. A number of the other plans he was responsible for in this area include St Mary's Priory and St Andrew's Church in North Berwick, Dirleton Collegiate Church and Dunbar Collegiate Church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketched ground-plan of Beauly Priory, Inverness-shire, entitled 'Beauly Priory - North'. It dates from August 1815, and the artist is 'Mr ______ Hog of Beauly'. This is one of several sketches and drawings from Beauly contained in the Hutton Collection, and describe the church at Beauly Priory, whose ruins are the only substantial remains of what was once a large priory complex. The dimensions of the building and of each individual window and door are on the plan. The locations of gardens and orchards in the priory grounds are also given. Beauly Priory is located at the east end of the main square of Beauly in Easter Ross. The village grew up around the priory, founded in the 1230s by Valliscaulian Monks from the French region of Burgundy. In the early sixteenth century, the adherence of the priory changed to the Cistercian order, but after the Reformation of 1560, it fell into disuse, and became a source of stone for other buildings in the village..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan, drawn by Alexander Morton in 1816, shows the remains of St Andrew's Church, North Berwick. Morton has included North Berwick Harbour and the Firth of Forth, and a scale and compass. Located to the east of the harbour, St Andrew's Church stood on an area of land that was once a small island; cut off from the mainland at high tide, it could be reached on foot at low tide. The church itself is thought to date from the twelfth century, although an even earlier date is possible. Another drawing in the Hutton Collection shows an imaginary reconstruction of the church..</dc:description>

The sketches include views and dimensions of the west and south sides of the square tower, and of the choir of the original collegiate church, which later became a new parish church. The west wall of the square tower measures 44½ feet at its highest point. The remains of the south wall are 32 feet in height, and the breadth of each wall is 20 feet. The thickness of the walls is 4½ feet. The ruined part of the old church was 40½ feet in length, and the remaining portion, which became the new church, was 40 feet in length..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This rough plan of Saddell Abbey, dated 18th August 1802, includes measurements and extensive notes regarding the abbey and the people buried in its grounds. According to the information provided, the building existed more or less in its entirety until 1766, when the proprietor 'took down a great part of it'. There are further drawings of Saddell Abbey and its interior in the Hutton Collection. Saddell Abbey stands close to the 'Alt nan Manach', or the 'Stream of the Monks', in Saddell Glen, Kintyre. Founded in the twelfth century by Somerled, Lord of the Isles, and completed by his son Reginald, Saddell Abbey was home to members of the Cistercian Order. Also known as 'white monks', the Cistercians lived a very austere and isolated existence, largely devoting their time to prayer and hard physical labour..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. A note in the top left-hand corner reads, 'See Morton's Plan'. This refers to a plan of Seton Collegiate Church by Alexander Morton that also forms part of the Hutton Collection. Measurements have been recorded in paces and the different areas of the church have been identified. As the note in the top-right corner of the plan confirms, the proprietor at this time was the Earl of Wemyss. Originally, the property of the Seton family, the church along with the Seton estates was eventually acquired by the Earl of Wemyss, who partially restored the church and used it as the family mausoleum. Seton Collegiate Church is now cared for by Historic Scotland and is open to the public..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note beneath the title of this watercolour reads, 'This rude sketch done from memory to show the effect is presented to Lieut. Hutton by his obliged humble servant, Buchan. Dryburgh Abbey Jan 1. 1789'. It is one of four views of Dryburgh Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection, two of which are the work of David Stewart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, who acquired the remains of the abbey in 1786. Dryburgh Abbey sits in a loop of the River Tweed a few hundred yards to the north of the village of St Boswells in Berwickshire. Hugh de Moreville, the Constable of Scotland, who invited the Premonstratensians, or Order of White Canons, to build and inhabit the abbey, founded it in 1150. Although the abbey was never particularly influential in Scottish religious or political life, English forces attacked it on several occasions, and it eventually fell into disuse after the Reformation of 1560..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Watercolour sketch of Cowie Church, near Stonehaven, Kincardineshire. The writing below this watercolour sketchreads, 'Reduced, Cowey Church near Stoneharbour, Kincardineshire'. The painting is unsigned by the artist (possibly Hutton himself), but is dated June 15th, 1790. This is the only image relating to Cowie or Stonehaven in the Hutton Collection. The name 'Stoneharbour' in the picture's title was probably a mistake, as Stonehaven does not appear to ever been that. Cowie, a village roughly a kilometre north-east of Stonehaven town centre, was, until the sixteenth century, a more significant settlement than Stonehaven, and was chartered as a burgh of barony. Cowie Church may date from at least the thirteenth century, and its remains, and its graveyard, are still there today..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A watercolour sketch of Elgin Cathedral, Moray; no other information is given. The Hutton Collection contains four other drawings pertaining to Elgin Cathedral, by various artists. In its heyday, Elgin Cathedral was the largest and most impressive building of its kind after St Andrews. Founded in 1224, it is now a magnificent ruin, managed by Historic Scotland. It boasts a fine octagonal vaulted chapter house, a Pictish cross slab, a large stone statue of a bishop, and table tombs in its burial ground..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A watercolour of Arbroath Abbey, Angus, this painting shows the remnants of the main building. It says ‘5 July 1790’, and is identified as number 11. The red sandstone used in the construction of the abbey is quite distinct in this drawing. It came from the cliffs located in the north-east area of the town The ruined towers probably formed the west end of the abbey's nave. King William the Lion founded Arbroath Abbey in 1178. Initially set up for a group of monks of the Order of Tiron (an offshoot of the Benedictine Order), the abbey is famous as the location where the Scottish nobles signed the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, which proclaimed Scotland's right to self-determination..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour drawing of St Andrew's Church, Gullane, East Lothian, was painted around 1791 by Thomas Cocking, 'Captain Grose's assistant'. Captain Grose was most likely Captain Francis Grose, the celebrated antiquarian and author of 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791. The artist has chosen to show the interior of the church, including the remains of a decorative archway. This watercolour is very likely of the twelfth-century parish church of St Andrew's, Gullane. In 1612, St Andrew's was abandoned and the parish church moved to the village of Dirleton. This was partly in response to the heavy sandstorms that plagued Gullane at this time. With its isolated and exposed location, the church was particularly vulnerable to the storms..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>R. Taylor painted this watercolour of Fail Monastery, Ayrshire in 1800. This is one of three views of Fail Monastery in the Hutton Collection. Taylor's painting shows a ruined section of the Monastery of Fail in the foreground, and the background, the rolling wooded hills north of the valley of the River Ayr. The monastery was founded in 1252 by Trinitarian or Red Friars, on a site where the Water of Fail meets the Ayr, about two miles south-east of Tarbolton. The monastery was not one of the more prominent in Scotland, but a satirical rhyme implying that the monks are hypocrites has survived, and reads: 'The Friars of Fail made gude kail / On Fridays when they fasted; / And they never wanted gear enough / As long as their neighbour's lasted'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour painting is by 'Capt. Grose's assistant', i.e. Thomas Cocking. It is dated '1747 or 1748', and is one of four views of Hamilton Collegiate Church contained in the Hutton Collection. 'Capt. Grose', who’s assistant is credited, as the artist of the painting, is a reference to Francis Grose (c.1731-91), like Hutton an English soldier and antiquary, and the author of books on the antiquities of Scotland, England and Wales. Hamilton Palace was the seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, and was begun in the late-eighteenth century in the grounds of Cadzow Castle, family home of the Barons of Cadzow who were ancestors of the Hamiltons. The collegiate church had been founded on an adjoining site in 1450-1, but apart from the transept shown in this painting, was demolished in the eighteenth century as Hamilton Palace was extended to become one of the grandest stately homes in Britain. The Palace was itself demolished in 1922 after subsidence caused by mine workings had rendered it unsafe..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note following the title of this watercolour reads, ' From a drawing made by Capt. Columbine in 1792'. Captain Columbine (c.1760-1811) was first a hydrographer, although as demonstrated here he was also an artist. This watercolour copies one of his drawings and shows Rothesay Castle within its natural surroundings. Rothesay Castle stands in the centre of the town of Rothesay, on the island of Bute. Whilst the present ruin dates from the early-thirteenth century, it is probable that a castle has stood on this site since the late-eleventh century. Famous for its water-filled moat and rather unusual circular wall, the castle is also well-known for its long association with the Stewart family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page contains two drawing of the Boatsford Stone, which is located in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. A note at the foot of the drawing states that it was 'presented to me by the late Capt. [Francis] Grose', who wrote the book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published in 1791. Grose probably made this drawing in or around 1790. Both drawings are rich in detail and perfectly capture the ornate decorations of the stone. The fact that there are two drawings suggests that these are front and rear elevation illustrations of the stone. Sadly, there does not seem to be much general information available concerning the Boatsford Stone..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch depicts the remains of the original stone arch of the Church of St Mary, in Dumbarton. A note at the foot of the page states that the sketch was from a Mr John Gilleson on the 26th of March 1822. It adds that, 'the Leven is seen through the arch, &amp; on the left, Smollett’s monument'. The arch, built in 1450, is the College Bow. The arch was originally part of the church of St Mary, which has long since vanished. Located in Church Street in Dumbarton town centre, houses and shops now flank the arch. This sketch is one of a pair of drawings of the College Bow Arch that appear in the Hutton Collection..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Print of Dundrennan Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire. This print is entitled 'DUNDRENNAN ABBEY PL. 1', and was a plate from Captain Francis Grose's book 'The Antiquities of Scotland Vol. II', which was published in London. The engraver's initials are 'J.N,' and a note at the bottom left hand side of the page reads ‘Publish’d Augst 29th 1789, by S. Hooper.’ Dundrennan Abbey, about 5 miles south-east of Kirkcudbright and 2 miles distant from the Solway coast, was founded in 1142 by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, and housed a community of Cistercian monks. The abbey became one of the richest in Scotland, and by the sixteenth century had its own representative in Parliament. However, like many of Scotland’s finest ecclesiastical buildings, its decline was rapid after the Reformation of the 1560, and it fell into ruin in the seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This print shows the front view of Gordon Castle, which is located near Fochabers, in Moray. In the foreground of the picture is a kilt-wearing Scottish soldier - most likely a Gordon Highlander - courting his sweetheart. While the print is dated 1819, the identity of the artist is unknown - however, it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. Designed by John Baxter, he built the modern castle - or rather palace - in 1769 for the 4th Duke of Gordon. Baxter's design replaced the original castle, built during the 1470s for George Gordon, the 2nd Earl of Huntly. The port and songwriter, Robert Burns, visited the castle during his Highland tour, and immortalised it in his song, 'Castle Gordon'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This light pencil sketch shows the south-west view of Beauly Priory, which lies close to where the Beauly River enters the Beauly Firth. The date reads 25th August 1815 and it includes a note of the location in the bottom left-hand corner. The artist has sketched much of the surrounding area, including Beauly River, nearby buildings, trees and fields. The Hutton Collection also includes drawings of the south view and north-east view. Local landowner, John Bisset founded Beauly Priory around 1230. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, it was one of three houses established in Scotland by the Valliscaulian Order: the other two being Ardchattan and Pluscarden. The Valliscaulian remained at Beauly until 1510, at which time the priory became a Cistercian House..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketched ground-plan of Hamilton Collegiate Church, Lanarkshire is not dated. Neither is the sketch signed by the artist. A note beneath the plan measures the width of the church from west to east at 'About fifteen paces'. It is not specified whether the smaller measurements, of walls, windows, doors and buttresses, have been made in feet or paces, although paces would appear more likely. This is one of four views of Hamilton Collegiate Church contained in the Hutton Collection. The sketch displayed here is probably a plan of only one transept of the original collegiate church. The transept housing the burial vault of the Barons of Cadzow and Dukes of Hamilton was all that was left intact of the church when it was demolished by James, 5th Duke of Hamilton, in the early-eighteenth century. In the mid-nineteenth century, the remains of the previous Dukes were moved to the nearby Hamilton Mausoleum, built between 1842 and 1857, is believed to be the biggest mausoleum in the world, apart from the pyramids at Giza in Egypt..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour drawing dates from August 1802 and shows the north-west view of the village of Saddell. A note underneath the drawing reads, 'The ruins of the abbey are among the trees to the right of the fine old elm tree and are shaded dark'. Much of the surrounding countryside has been included, and Saddell Bay forms an impressive backdrop to the whole scene. The village of Saddell is located around eight miles north of Campbeltown, on the eastern edge of the Kintyre Peninsula, Argyllshire, close to where the Saddell Water meets the Kilbrannan Sound. The remains of the abbey lie to the west of the village and Saddell Castle lies to the South. A large amount of the stonework from the twelfth-century abbey went into the construction of Saddell Castle in the early-sixteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil drawing, of the north-west aspect of Elgin Cathedral, Moray, bears the words 'Pan Port, the gate on the left', after the title. Hutton himself probably drew it. The manses of the secular canons grouped around the cathedral, within the precinct, enclosed by a stone wall, which had four gates. Between 1820 and 1840, Elgin expanded and the authorities demolished the other three ports, or gates. The only gate that still survives is the Pans Port, 'the gate on the left'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although this picture is unsigned, it is likely that George Henry Hutton drew the picture himself. The south-west view of the church is very similar to that in a sketch made six years later, also apparently by Hutton. However, this earlier sketch seems to be from a more elevated and slightly more distant position, revealing clearly that the priority sits in a valley, surrounded by low, rolling hills. The area of Scotland now known as Angus was once the Pictish province of Circenn, and at the heart of this province was Restenneth. The missionary Boniface, who allegedly brought Christianity to the Picts of Circenn, may have founded church in Restenneth in the seventh or eighth century. After the subsequent demise of the Picts, the site retained its ecclesiastical connotations, and Augustinian canons built a priory here in the twelfth century; the parts of the priory that survive date mainly from this period..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The name of the artist is not given, and it is probable that this is one of Hutton's own sketches. A note beneath the title reads, 'This sketch shows the steeple and part of the roof of the Parish Church. The Priory sat about 80 yards to the North-East of the church, but not a vestige remains. The exterior of the church is uncommonly plain, but the inside exhibits marks of considerable antiquity, particularly a circular arch near the East end'. Monymusk is a village on the River Don, seven or eight miles south-west of Inverurie. There is evidence of early human settlement in the area, in the form of standing stones and the remains of a seventh-century Culdee priory church. This may not have been the priory in Hutton's notes, as there are also records of an Augustinian priory having been set up in Monymusk in 1170..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows 'Bickerton's Cenotaph' in the ruins of Luffness Friary, near Aberlady. The tomb is protected by the figure of a thirteenth-century knight, with a sword in his right hand and a shield protecting his heart. He lies on top of a stone coffin in an arched recess, near the remains of the high altar. A more detailed drawing of the tomb can also be found in the Hutton Collection. The tomb is said to be that of Sir David de Lindsay who granted the land for the monastery to the Carmelites in the thirteenth century. During the Crusades, Sir David fell ill and he was cared for by members of the order. Although he died soon after, he repaid the Carmelites' kindness with this gift of land..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Watercolour of the chancel of St Mary's Chapel, St Ronan's Nunnery, Iona, Argyllshire, 'from a drawing made on the spot by Capt. E.H. Columbine, R.N., 1792'. This view of the ruined interior of St Mary's Church is facing to the north-west. The chancel was the area of the church, where the clergy and choir sat during services. It is located between the high altar and the nave, where the rest of the congregation sit. The community, when founded in the thirteenth century, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the first generation of Canonesses was mainly of Irish origin. The ruins, depicted here before a minor clean up operation managed by the Duke of Argyll in 1849, are the best-preserved remains in Europe of a female Augustinian community.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch dates from August 1802, but is unsigned. It shows the church and tower of Kilmun nestling on the shores of the Holy Loch, and features people strolling by the loch and boats close to shore. It is one of several drawings and sketches of Kilmun in the Hutton Collection. The distinctive square tower in Kilmun is the remaining part of a collegiate church founded in 1442 by Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochawe, chief of the Clan Campbell and an ancestor of the Dukes of Argyll. The churchyard in Kilmun has been the burial place of the Campbells of Argyll since then. Although the village became a ‘burgh of barony’ in 1490, it did not develop significantly because of the limitations on land-space imposed by the steep hills behind the village..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This rough sketch shows Innerwick Castle viewed from below. Whilst it is difficult to distinguish the castle from the surrounding scenery, another drawing in the Hutton Collection shows a similar scene in much more detail. It is possible they are both by the same artist and that this example was merely a preliminary sketch. Innerwick Castle is situated on a rocky eminence close to the Thornton Burn, near the village of Innerwick. The ruins that can be seen today are thought to date from the fifteenth century, although a castle is said to have stood on this site since the fourteenth century. Originally built for the Stewart family, it eventually passed to the Hamiltons before being destroyed by the Duke of Somerset in the mid-sixteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch of Fyvie Castle, Aberdeenshire is by a 'Mr Cordiner'. The sketch shows the south front of the castle. 'Mr Cordiner' may be a reference to Charles Cordiner (1746-94), Episcopalian minister of Banff, who produced two books of drawings of buildings and landscapes of the north of Scotland in the late eighteenth century. Alternatively, it could be a reference to the lesser known Reverend James Cordiner, who was responsible for some sketches in the Hutton Collection. This sketch has no date, which makes identifying the artist more difficult..</dc:description>

The inn referred to in the artist's note is most probably the Wee Bush Inn. It dates from the 1750s; and was a popular resting place for travellers. Thomas, Lord Somerville founded the collegiate church in the 1420s. It was home to a provost and six prebendaries, and served as the Somerville's family mausoleum for many years..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This rough drawing, made in 1811, shows the interior of the Franciscan Friary at Dumfries. A note at the bottom right corner of the drawing reads, 'Grey Friar Dumfries 1811'. Although the name of the artist has not been included, it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. Lady Devorgilla, daughter of the last Lord of Galloway, founded Dumfries Friary, also known as Greyfriars Convent, in or around 1262. Set in a beautiful location overlooking the River Nith, legend has it that the friary is where Robert the Bruce killed the Red Comyn, thus sparking off the Scottish Wars of Independence..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of the exterior of the west end of Elgin Cathedral, Moray, 'from a slight sketch by the Reverend J. Cordiner’. Hutton himself probably copied the sketch from James Cordiner’s original. There are another four drawings of Elgin Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. During its prime, the cathedral at Elgin was the second largest in Scotland, after St Andrews. Its nickname is the 'Lantern of the North'. The cathedral's west front is a fine example of sixteenth-century ecclesiastical architecture, and Hutton's collection of ecclesiastical drawings would not be complete without it. Elgin Cathedral fell into disuse after the Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Lincluden Collegiate Church. This plan reads, 'Lincluden given me by Capt. Grose 1790'. Captain Grose was most likely Francis Grose, the celebrated antiquarian and author of 'The Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1791. The plan shows the different areas of the church, including the high altar, great court, choir, cloister and the Countess of Galloway's [i.e. Douglas's] tomb. The Countess of Galloway's tomb is located in the south-east of the church close to the sacristy. It is the final resting place of Margaret, wife of the 4th Earl of Douglas and daughter of King Robert III. The tomb includes a stone effigy and is located in a small recess. Today, the ruins belong to Historic Scotland and are open to the public..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Undated sketch of an engraving from a tombstone, in St Clement's Church, Harris, Inverness-shire. Hutton’s note names the artist as Mr Daniell. Hutton does not describe exactly what the sketch contains, but the words of the sketched inscription, mainly in Latin, indicate that it is an engraving on the tombstone of Alexander Macleod. Harris and Dunvegan, in North Skye, are historically seats of the Clan Macleod, and St Clement’s is the family’s traditional burial place. The tomb of Alexander Macleod of Dunvegan and Harris, also known as Alasdair Crotach or Humpback, is located in the south-east part of St Clement's church, and dates from 1528. The church, in Rodel, South Harris, is believed to have been built on the site of an earlier ecclesiastical building, and historical sources are divided over whether the present St Clement's dates from the fifteenth or early sixteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of various drawings and sketches made at the Augustinian Priory at Restenneth, near Forfar. This unsigned sketch may be the work of Hutton himself. The detail on this sketch suggests that although the roof was completely gone from most of Restenneth Priory by 1814, the walls were still largely intact, and held large and elaborate sculpted stones. This ornamentation is particularly evident on the north wall, to the left of the picture. The remains of Restenneth Priory date mainly from the twelfth century, but may also include seventh- or eighth-century stones from a Pictish foundation on the same site..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil drawing is 'from a sketch by the Reverend Cordiner'. Cordiner, of St Paul's Chapel, Aberdeen, was, between 1799 and 1804, chaplain to the garrison of Colombo in Sri Lanka and principal of all schools on the island. His book 'A Description of Ceylon’ was published in 1807. It is probable that Hutton copied this sketch from Cordiner's original. Elgin Cathedral began as a chapter-house (a meeting place for the governing body of the cathedral) in 1244, and reached its full size by the end of the thirteenth century. The cathedral suffered badly in the Reformation, and was a quarry and a rubbish dump in the nineteenth century. Eventually, the Government took over the site and it is now a popular tourist attraction..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This faint sketch shows the interior of what are probably the remains of the old parish church of St Andrews, in Gullane. Whilst extremely faint, it is possible to make out two large archways. This sketch is one of several drawings in the Hutton Collection that detail the remains of the church. One of the other drawings in the collection, also dated 1785, shows the interior from the same angle but in much more detail. It includes some of the decoration above the archway on the right. Built in the twelfth century, the parish church of St Andrews was eventually abandoned in 1612 and replaced by a parish church established in Dirleton..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note at the bottom of the page, in Hutton's hand, reads, 'By ____ Nisbet, Painter at Forres, 1816'. This may have been Andrew Nisbet. A scale and key have been included below the title. Hutton has made other notes on the plan, which seem to criticise Mr Nisbet's draughtsmanship! King David I founded Kinloss Abbey around 1150. Situated beside Kinloss Burn, north of Forres, monks of the Cistercian Order from Melrose settled the Abbey. Its central tower collapsed in 1574, but it was included in Pont's 1600 map and the abbey was still obviously an impressive structure. In 1601, Edward Bruce, Lord Kinloss bought it. In 1650, the structure received its final blow when Cromwell took the stone to build a fort at Inverness. Today it is a popular visitor attraction although only two of the original arches remain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Sketch of a monumental stone found by grave-diggers in Coupar Angus, Perthshire. The monument carries an engraving of a sword, resembling a claymore, running the length of the stone, and around the blade are words which appear to read 'HIC: IACET WILL DE: MONGE: HIPO'. The notes beneath the drawing do not offer a translation of this. Although there are drawings from Coupar Angus in the Hutton Collection that appear to be the work of other artists, Hutton seems to have made this sketch personally. Beneath the title, he has added a note, which reads: 'It was found (26 Aug. 1820) in digging a grave in the church Yard. Placed erect when drawn'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Faint sketch of a feature on a monument in Beauly Priory, Inverness-shire. The sheet is undated and is unsigned, but it is likely that George Henry Hutton himself was the artist. The sketch appears to be of the skull or head of an animal, perhaps a reindeer that is on a monument in the priory. It is one of number of drawings and sketches from Beauly in the Hutton Collection. Beauly Priory, in Inverness-shire, was one of three priories founded in the thirteenth century by Valliscaulian monks from the French region of Burgundy. They originally named it 'Prioratus de Bello Loco', which is Latin for 'Priory of the Lovely Spot'. When Mary, Queen of Scots visited the priory in 1564, she is reputed to have described the priory in French as 'un beau lieu', or 'a beautiful place', which may have given the name of the priory and village its modern pronunciation. In the title of his sketch, Hutton has retained the French spelling..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of a south-west view of Restenneth Priory, Angus. The artist's name is missing, but it is likely that Hutton made it himself. This is one of several sketches of Restenneth Priory in the Collection, and gives an impression of the setting of the priory, among trees and with rolling hills to the north-east. This sketch suggests that Restenneth Priory, when the artist visited it, looked much the same as it does today. The steeple is nearly intact, but the adjoining buildings are partial ruins. Most of the buildings date from the Augustinian priory founded in the twelfth century, but some stones from a seventh- or eighth-century Pictish church on the same site form part of the walls..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A sketch of a south-east view of Guthrie Collegiate Church, Angus, dated September 1814 and probably one of Hutton's own sketches. It shows a modest, single-storey L-shaped church building surrounded by a graveyard filled with ancient-looking, irregularly-positioned tombstones. The village of Guthrie lies approximately eleven kilometres east of Forfar and had a church by 1150 that became collegiate in the late fifteenth century. People founded and dedicated Collegiate churches in Scotland to securing salvation and the favour of God for their families. The churches often later came to have schools attached to them..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here, the artist has sketched a sculptured stone found above the doorway of Tongland Mill. It shows a figure holding what is possibly a coat of arms. The artist has not included background information regarding the stone and its location. The Hutton Collection also includes a drawing of the north-west view of Tongland Church and another sketch detailing a stone carving. The village of Tongland is on the River Dee, around two miles north of Kirkcudbright, in Dumfriesshire. It has a long history and houses an abbey founded in the twelfth century. Part of this - a doorway - built into an early parish church, is still in the present-day kirkyard..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows a stone carving found in a house in Tongland. Whilst the detail on the stone is very faint, there is the suggestion of a face. The Hutton Collection also includes a drawing of the north-west view of Tongland Church and another sketch detailing a sculptured stone. The ancient hamlet of Tongland is located in the parish of the same name, in Dumfriesshire. Situated on the River Dee, it lies approximately two miles north-east of Kirkcudbright and was once home to an abbey founded by Fergus, Lord of Galloway. Francis Groome relayed an interesting story regarding the last Abbot of the abbey, an Italian alchemist named Damian, in the 'Ordnance Gazetteer' (1894). Allegedly, Damian attempted to fly from the parapet of Stirling Castle to France in the presence of James IV. He apparently landed in a nearby midden and fractured his thigh bone!.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>George Hutton made this pencil sketch, of a stone coffin, Kinloss Abbey, Moray. He drew several sketches of the abbey, and the Hutton Collection contains a plan of the grounds, by Andrew Nisbet. King David I of Scotland founded Kinloss Abbey in 1150. It was colonised by monks from the Cistercian Order who came from Melrose. It was a large and impressive structure that stood, in various states of repair, for 500 years before finally being torn down to be used by Oliver Cromwell in building a fort at Inverness..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of a sculpted stone in Coupar Angus, Perthshire. The sculpture on the stone appears to be of a royal or heraldic shield, displaying the lion rampant and a crown. It is likely that Hutton was the artist, as well as the author of a note below the title that reads 'It is built into the wall of a house opposite the church Yard gate'. Although the stone depicted in the drawing does not carry a date, it is quite likely that it was originally part of the eleventh century Cistercian Abbey at Coupar Angus. After Protestant reformers burnt the Abbey buildings in 1559, locals dismantled the remains for building materials. This could explain why an ornamental stone ended up in the wall of an ordinary house..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This was drawn by William Daniell, in July 1818, and shows the tomb of Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris, in St Clement's Church, Rodel. The Hutton Collection contains further drawings and plans detailing St Clement's, including another drawing of Alexander's tomb by Daniell. Whilst the one seen here is possibly Daniell's preliminary sketch, it is very difficult to distinguish between the two drawings. Alexander Macleod of Dunvegan and Harris, who was also known as Alexander Crotach or Humpback, is believed to have built St Clement's Church in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century. His tomb is located in the south-eastern part of the church and is dated 1528. The detailed carving around his tomb, which includes biblical references, may be the finest example of medieval sculpture in the whole of the Western Isles..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title on this sheet but it is likely that the rubbing was from the smaller bell at Holywood Abbey. This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is also likely that this image dates from 1811. A series of six rubbings together transcribe the bell's inscription. The inscription totals a length of thirty-one and half inches, with the mouth of the bell having a circumference of 54 inches. These six rubbings are only part of a series of images taken of Holywood Abbey. The other four all record both bells too - they seem to have been a source of curiosity amongst nineteenth century antiquaries..</dc:description>

This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is also likely that this image dates from 1811. The monk Congall probably founded the Abbey as a Premonstratensian House. The order, originating in Laon, France, was monastic, partly canonical and, in practice, the monks divided their time between prayer and working the land. There routine was based on the Rule of St Augustine but had been amended to reflect their mixed purpose. This house was not only one of a network of religious establishments spread across southern Scotland but was also one of two houses, the other at Dryburgh, who lived a Premonstratensian lifestyle..</dc:description>

This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is likely, because of the facts that it dates from 1811. There are six rubbings of the decoration on the smaller bell at Holywood, contained in the Hutton Drawings and a further four of the bells themselves. There were two bells at the Abbey, still extant during Hutton’s lifetime. They seem to have caused some interest amongst antiquarians. They eventually ended up in the nearby parish church..</dc:description>

This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is also likely dated 1811. This rubbing is relatively unusual amongst those held in the Collection, as it does not depict Latin script. It shows the initials 'V.H.’ and a coat of arms depicting three crosses and two diagonals. Premonstratensian Monks inhabited the Abbey at Holywell. It is likely that the monk Congall founded this house, and certainly, his name appears in local topographical names. After the Reformation, the Abbey bells moved to the local parish church. It was from here that these rubbings came..</dc:description>

This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is also likely that the image dates from 1811. This is one of five rubbings, which transcribe the inscription: the sixth rubbing depicting the coat of arms on the bell. There were two bells at the Abbey, large and small, which later ended up in the local parish church. The smaller of the two carried this inscription which measures about thirty-one and a half inches all the way round. Although a cheap and effective method of exact reproduction, it has now been realised the creating rubbings of monuments actually defaces them and increases their rate of deterioration. As a result, the practise is now discouraged..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title on this sheet but it is likely that the rubbing was from the smaller bell at Holywood Abbey. This is mainly due to the rubbing’s position in the collection and the references made to this rubbing in accompanying notes. It is also likely that this image dates from 1811. The rim of the bell is clearly visible. This is also one of four images showing the inscription round the bell. There were two bells at Holywood Abbey that ended up in the local parish church. The small bell was nineteen inches high, with a circumference of fifty–four inches at its mouth. The circumference of the actual inscription was thirty-one and a half inches. The larger of the bells was only another inch higher and wider though..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Annotated drawing of Kilwinning Abbey, Ayrshire. A note at the top, under the title, continues 'communicated by the Revd. Wm. Pollock'. It is one of three images of Kilwinning Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection, each by a different artist. The numbered annotations on the sheet indicate the Steeple, a building that is 'supposed to be Hall of the Abbot's House', and the churchyard. The ruins of the medieval abbey dominate the centre of the Ayrshire town of Kilwinning. The abbey was a Tironesian foundation, built in 1162, and apparently, when still intact, was very similar in structure to Glasgow Cathedral, which dated from between the 1130s and the 1190s. While Glasgow Cathedral was one of the few significant Scottish monastic buildings to survive the Reformation of 1560 relatively undamaged, Kilwinning was less fortunate..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page shows a heavily annotated, untitled, ground plan of Sweetheart Abbey, in the village of New Abbey, Dumfries and Galloway. George Henry Hutton obtained the plan from a Mr William Wright in 1789, and it is one of three drawings or sketches relating to New Abbey in the Hutton Collection. The annotations identify the locations of the different parts of the abbey complex, and in some cases provide dimensions. They also give extensive descriptions of the abbey's ornamented doorways, walls and tombs. Today Sweetheart Abbey is a ruin, but substantial enough parts of it remain to show that it was once a beautiful and elaborate building. Its romantic name came from its community of Cistercian monks, who named it in tribute to its founder Devorgilla, Lady of Galloway. Devorgilla founded the abbey in 1273 in memory of her husband John Balliol, the father of the Scottish King of the same name..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This page includes a rough sketch of what is, probably, the Royal Burgh of Haddington coat of arms, and a description of the interior of the church. The note begins 'Arms on one of buttresses of the Franciscan Church at Haddington. It is the buttress on the East side of the great window in the South transept'. Although reference is made to the 'Franciscan Church', it is perhaps more familiarly known as St Mary's Collegiate Church. The east wall of St Mary's features a stone carving of a goat and vine, which is a symbol that has been associated with Haddington since the Middle Ages and is still in evidence in the town today. It is claimed by some of the townspeople that, prior to the nineteenth century, a stone goat adorned the top of the mercat cross..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of a monument at Ardchattan Priory, Argyllshire. It shows three pointed archways within a larger round archway set within a stone wall. A large stone slab covers the ground underneath the main arch. The artist has included a note regarding its location and history. Located in a secluded spot on the banks of Loch Etive, near Oban, Argyllshire, Duncan MacDougall founded Ardchattan in the mid-thirteenth century. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, it was one of only three houses in Scotland belonging to the Valliscaulian Order, the other two being Beauly and Pluscarden..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a monument located in the interior of Ardchattan Priory, which lies on the banks of Loch Etive, near Oban, Argyllshire. The monument comprises six carved figures, both male and female, located in highly decorative niches, with inscription around the periphery. There are several other drawings in the Hutton Collection, mostly dating from 1820, detailing the interior and exterior of Ardchattan Priory. Founded in the thirteenth century by Duncan MacDougall, Ardchattan Priory was home to members of the Valliscaulian Order. Whilst the monks only remained at Ardchattan until the mid-sixteenth century, religious services continued there until the mid-eighteenth century. Today, Historic Scotland cares for the ruins and they are open to the public..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of a bell from Holywood Abbey, one of a pair in the Hutton Collection, dates from around 1811. A transcript of the Latin inscription that appears at the top of the bell is at the bottom of the drawing. The name of the artist is missing; it is likely that it was Hutton himself. These two bells from the abbey are in the local parish church at Holywood. Although little now remains of Holyrood Abbey, it was a famous religious centre during the Middle Ages. The abbey constructed in the English Gothic style, in 1180, housed Premonstratensians, monks who came to Scotland from Laon, in France..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a fragment of a statue of Johannes de Sacro Bosco, who was a famous mathematician and astronomer during the thirteenth century. A note says that it was, 'From a sketch by the late Dr [Robert] Claperton, Annan, 23d. Oct. 1811.' The Hutton Collection contains another drawing that depicts an adjoining section of this statue. It appears that the fragments of the statue which this drawing is based on was originally housed in Holyrood Abbey, but was later kept in Terragles, near Dumfries. The '1232 Visit' note underneath the drawing suggests that Johannes de Sacro Bosco, also known as John of Holywood or Halifax, possibly visited Scotland in that year. Sacro Bosco is most famous for writing the tract, 'Tractatus de Sphera' (c. 1233), which is a fundamental medieval text on astronomy, based on Ptolemy's theories..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is another drawing of a statue of Johannes de Sacro Bosco, Friars' Carse, Dumfriesshire. It is one of a pair the Hutton Collection. It is a portrayal of the lower part of a statue of Johannes de Sacro Bosco, who was a famous astronomer and mathematician during the early thirteenth century; a note at the foot states that this fragment, 'was removed from Holywood to Terragles at the Reformation, and is now to be seen at Friars Carse', Nithsdale. It also says that the drawing, dated October 1811, was based on a sketch by Dr Robert Claperton of Annan. 'Tractatus de Sphera' (c. 1233), which is a fundamental medieval text on astronomy, based on Ptolemy's theories, is probably the most famous of Sacro Bosco's tracts..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of the south-east view of St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington, East Lothian appeared in volume two of 'The Antiquities of Scotland' (1792), by Captain Francis Grose. It shows St Mary's Collegiate Church from the south-east. The artist has also chosen to detail much of the surrounding area in this sketch, including the River Tyne, the sixteenth-century Nungate Bridge and part of the town. The first Franciscan friary in Scotland was founded in the early-thirteenth century. Others soon followed and by the end of the century there were several throughout Scotland, including one in Haddington. Although the artist has chosen to title the sketch 'Franciscan Church', this ecclesiastical building is more familiarly known as St Mary's Collegiate Church. Built in the fourteenth century, St Mary's is not only the largest parish church in Scotland but is also considered one of the three great pre-Reformation churches of the Lothians: St Giles in Edinburgh and St Michael's in Linlithgow are the other two..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This print of a drawing by George Henry Hutton, of the south-east view of St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington, appeared in the 'Archaeologia Scotica or, Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland', published in 1792. The detail shown by Hutton extends to include the sixteenth-century Nungate Bridge and much of the surrounding area. Known as the 'Lamp of Lothian', possibly due to the red sandstone used in its construction, St Mary's Collegiate Church dates from the fourteenth century and is the largest parish church in Scotland. Along with St Giles in Edinburgh and St Michael's in Linlithgow, St Mary's is also considered one of the great pre-Reformation churches of the Lothians. Badly damaged in 1548, the church underwent partial restoration at the behest of John Knox (1505-72). It was not fully restored until the 1970s. Hutton's drawing clearly shows that the main body of St Mary's at this time was still open to the elements..</dc:description>

The artist's name has not been included. Thomas, Lord Somerville, founded Carnwath Collegiate Church in the 1420s on the site of a pre-existing church. The only part of the original collegiate church that remains today is St Mary's Aisle - the entrance to which is in this drawing. For many years, St Mary's served as the family mausoleum for the Somervilles..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing of a monument at Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire, shows a large stone slab decorated with a carved sword, and includes the length and breadth in feet and inches. A note under the title reads, 'It lies within the church near Macdonald'. Saddell Abbey is located in the Saddell Glen, on the eastern coastline of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyllshire. Somerled, Lord of the Isles, founded the Cistercian Abbey at Saddell in the twelfth century. The 'MacDonald' referred to in the note at the bottom of this drawing was most likely one of Somerled's descendants: Somerled's grandson, Donald, gave his name to the clan MacDonald..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of a partially obliterated carving at Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. The title below this pencil sketch reads, 'Monument at Sadael Abbey / 19 Aug 1802 / The sculpture is nearly obliterated'. There is a further note, which identifies this as a bird's-eye view. There is no name attached to this sheet, but as implied by the numbering at the top this is one of series of monument sketches contained in the Hutton Collection. This picture, captured 200 years ago now, is a hardcopy record of information that was disappearing then and is still deteriorating. There were many carved stones left at Saddell and together they provide a window into this complex, early medieval, period in Scotland's history. The melting pot of Celtic, Norse and Native cultures come together on remains such as this..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of a pillar in a churchyard, Inverness, Inverness-shire. This drawing reads simply, 'Inverness'. A note beneath the title explains 'The fragment here represented stands in the Burial Ground a few yards north-west of the church, and is said to be a remnant of the Grey Friars Monastery. Aug 11. 1815. The height of the Pillar to the top of the Capital is about 9 feet'. The name of the artist is not given, and it may be that this is one of Hutton's own drawings. The steeple in the background of the drawing is that of the Old High Parish Church. King Alexander II established a monastery in Inverness in 1233. As Hutton's note and the name of the site suggest, it was thought for a long time that the monastery had housed Franciscan or Grey Friars, but it is now known that the Order of monks in Inverness were in fact Dominican or Black Friars. After the monastery fell into decline, its stones were used by Oliver Cromwell's troops to build a fort to the north of the town, and only the pillar depicted in this drawing was left standing..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil sketch, of a feature at Crossraguel, is difficult to make out but appears to resemble the abbey's 'sedilia'. 'Sedilia' is the plural of the Latin ‘sedile’, meaning chair, and denotes the places used by the clergy whilst officiating during the liturgy. This style of stone seat is peculiar to Great Britain where they usually have three seats - one each for celebrant, deacon, and sub-deacon. The 'sedilia' at Crossraguel dates from the 1400s..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Funerary monument from Beauly Priory, Ross-shire. The note along the bottom of the sheet goes on to record the Latin inscription around the base of the slab and the details of figure, which surmounts it. The whole sculpture nestles in an arched and decorated niche. Funerary monuments for members of the upper classes and aristocracy were popular through the middle ages in northern Scotland as a demonstration of power and status. These free-standing, three-dimensional sculptures were the descendants of much earlier and two-dimensional carved slabs. Examples of these antecedents are also included in the Hutton Collection, along with another eleven views of Beauly Priory..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a gate to Dumbarton Castle, with the rocky cliffs on either side acting as a natural frame for the picture. It is likely that this gate is the fourteenth century Portcullis Arch, which is the oldest part of the existing castle. A note below the drawing reads 'a gate in Dumbarton Castle - copied from a drawing made on the spot by Capt. [Edward] Columbine, R.R'. There is no date included on the drawing. The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London owns the original of this drawing. Located at an important strategic position on the River Clyde, Dumbarton Castle boasts a rich history dating back to at least AD 450. William Wallace, Robert the Bruce and Mary, Queen of Scots are just some of the famous figures in Scottish history who were involved in famous events at the castle..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated drawing is by 'Capt. Grose's assistant'. Captain Francis Grose (1731-91), was an antiquary and author whose work features prominently in the Hutton Collection. His assistant, Thomas Cocking, was also responsible for a few drawings in the collection. This is one of three pictures relating to New Abbey in the collection, but apparently the only one drawn by Cocking. The village of New Abbey in Kirkcudbrightshire takes its name from the Cistercian abbey founded there in 1273 by Devorgilla, Lady of Galloway, in memory of her husband John Balliol (father of the Scottish King of the same name). She called it 'New Abbey' to distinguish it from Dundrennan Abbey, which is also in Kirkcudbrightshire. Although the village has retained the name New Abbey, the abbey itself is now 'Sweetheart Abbey', a name coined by the monks as a tribute to Devorgilla 's kindness and charity..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, which dates from August 1815, shows one of several gravestones from Beauly Priory, Ross-shire. The decoration is well preserved and the stone appears to have suffered minimal damage. The notes underneath the drawing suggest that a number of gravestones in the grounds of the priory now appear on modern graves with new inscriptions. Founded by John Bisset as a Valliscaulian House in the 1230s, work on Beauly Priory finally ended around 1272. It underwent an extensive restoration and rebuilding programme in the 1430s, but eventually fell in to disuse and disrepair during the Reformation despite improvements carried out by Prior Robert Reid in 1541. Whilst much of the priory now lies in ruins, or has completely disappeared, the architect Alexander Ross successfully rebuilt the north transept in 1901..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a large stone slab with detailed carvings of two swords and a ship. It is one of around a dozen carved stones on view today in the grounds of the Abbey. Originally thought carved on Iona, it is now more likely that someone made the stones in a workshop at Saddell. The monuments and grave slabs at Saddell commemorate the Lordship of the Isles and the warrior class to which it belonged. Stone portraits immortalise some of the great warriors and represented in the carvings are symbols of power and domination, including ships, swords and suits of armour..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of a monument in Kilmun Collegiate Church, Argyllshire, dates from August 1802, but is unsigned. The significance of this monument is not on the sheet, but it is probably the tomb of the Black Knight of Loch Awe and his consort, which is in the vault of the church. The Black Knight of Loch Awe was a name given to Sir Duncan Campbell, chief of the Clan Campbell and an ancestor of the ducal family of Argyll. Campbell founded Kilmun Collegiate Church in 1442 on the burial place of his son Celestine, who had died about 1440. Thereafter the churchyard at Kilmun became the last resting place of the Campbell chiefs and the Dukes of Argyll..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This was drawn by William Daniell, in 1818, and shows a funerary monument located in the south aisle of St Clement's Church, Rodel, Harris. The note regarding a plan could be referring to a drawing of the interior by John Macleod, which also forms part of the Hutton Collection. St Clement's Church is believed to have been built in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century, on the site of a much earlier church, by Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris. The funerary monument detailed here is possibly that of Alexander's son, William, who succeeded as clan leader following his father's death. Drawings of Alexander's elaborate tomb are also contained in the Hutton Collection..</dc:description>

The width and length of the monument have been included and a note records its location: 'It lies near the East end of the Burial ground'. A carved sword surrounded by a decorative pattern adorns the stone. This drawing is one of many in the Hutton Collection that detail the extraordinary stone carvings found at Saddell. The stone carvings at Saddell were the work of expert craftsmen. These show five portraits of those they commemorate and as six grave covers. Swords, armour and ships are common symbols found on the Saddell stones and are linked to the abbey's founder, the twelfth-century warrior-king of the Isles known as Somerled, and his followers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This south-east view of Abbey St Bathans Church, Berwickshire is dated 1788 but is unsigned by the artist. Although the title describes the building as a nunnery, it is in fact the church at Abbey St Bathans. This incorporates parts of the twelfth century Cistercian nunnery burnt by Henry VIII's troops in 1544. Abbey St Bathans is located in the Whiteadder Valley north of Duns in Berwickshire. It takes its name from St Bathan, a friend or cousin of St Columba, and perhaps his successor at Iona, who reputedly founded a cell there in the sixth century..</dc:description>

The artist has dated it October 15th, 1800, but has not signed it. This is one of four views of the church contained in the Hutton Collection. Hutton's note under the title reads, 'The situation is close to the palace, and has been long the Family Burial Place'. Hamilton Collegiate Church was founded in 1450-1 by Sir James Hamilton, 6th Lord Cadzow, 1st Lord Hamilton, and ancestor of the Dukes of Hamilton. The church was the burial place for the Barons and Dukes of Hamilton until the building of the Hamilton Mausoleum in the mid-nineteenth century, and when the 5th Duke of Hamilton demolished the Collegiate Church in the early eighteenth century, the transept housing the Hamilton burial vault was left intact..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This south-west view of Dryburgh Abbey, Berwickshire is one of four views of Dryburgh Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection. The remains of Dryburgh Abbey differ in an important respect from those of the other major border abbeys at Jedburgh, Kelso and Melrose. In each of those places, the most substantial remains are of the abbey church. At Dryburgh, the church has largely disappeared, but more substantial sections of the domestic areas of the abbey complex remain than at any of the other sites. This has allowed historians and archaeologists to find out a great deal, about how the monks lived from day to day. The abbey, founded for the Premonstratensians, or Order of White Canons, in 1150, fell into disuse after the Reformation of 1560..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is a south-west view of Fail Monastery, Ayrshire. It dates from 10th October 1800, but is unsigned. This is one of three drawings or sketches of Fail Monastery contained in the Hutton Collection. Fail, or Failford, is a hamlet about two miles south-east of Tarbolton, in Ayrshire, at the point where the Water of Fail meets the River Ayr. Trinitarian or Red Friars founded the monastery at Fail in about 1252. Like many Scottish monastic foundations, the Reformation of 1560 partially destroyed it, and the buildings passed into the ownership of the Wallace family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A fainter note directly after the title of this drawing reads, 'Since removed'. The artist is not named, although it is likely that it was Hutton himself. This is the only drawing or sketch of Lesmahagow Priory contained in the Hutton Collection. Hutton's note can be dated to after 1803, as this is when the priory was demolished. Lesmahagow Priory was founded around AD 1140 by King David I of Scotland and John, Bishop of Glasgow. The priory was affiliated to Kelso Abbey, and as such was inhabited by monks of the Tironesian Order. Despite being burned by English troops in 1335, the abbey continued to thrive until the Reformation of 1560, when it was largely demolished. The nave and tower were retained and used as a parish church until 1803..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a stone cross that was located at the west door of Holywood Abbey, near Dumfries. This sketch forms part of a sequence of drawings in the Hutton Collection that relate to Holywood Abbey. A scribbled note to the right of the drawing states the stone's dimensions, and the artist describes the ruins surrounding the stone. The artist is unknown. Monks of the Premonstratensian Order from Laon, in France, most likely built Holywood Abbey in 1180. The cruciform-shaped Abbey is in an English Gothic style, with a Norman arch and an oak roof. The surviving section of the abbey lasted until 1778 with the stones reconstructed into the village's parish church. Only a few remains are now left of the abbey..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This pencil drawing details a monument from Saddell Abbey, on the eastern edge of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyllshire. The monument is one of several stone carvings at Saddell and shows a figure clutching a shield. Further decorative detail and an inscription appear underneath. A note at the bottom of this drawing reads, 'It lies a few yards to the East of the church in the Burial place of Dugald Campbell Esqr. [?] of Glen Carradell [?]. 1802. It was removed by Mr Macalastair [?] from within the church'. Founded in the twelfth century by Somerled, Lord of the Isles, and completed by his son Reginald, Saddell Abbey was home to monks of the Cistercian Order. Also called 'white monks', due to the simple white robes they wore, the Cistercians chose an austere existence, dividing their time between prayer and hard work. The location of the abbey, in the Saddell Glen, was ideal for the monks, providing them with the necessary peace and isolation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing details one of several tombs in Seton Collegiate Church. Located in an arched recess in the interior of the church, the figure of a knight clutching a shield against his breast lies along the length of a stone coffin. A number of other drawings highlighting important features of the church can also be found in the Hutton Collection. Built in the fifteenth century upon the site of an earlier parish church, Seton Collegiate Church was founded by Lord Seton as a place of perpetual prayer for the Seton family. It remained in the family until the early-eighteenth century when, along with the rest of the Seton estates, it was forfeited as punishment for supporting the failed Jacobite Rebellion of 1715..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tombstone at Beauly Priory, Inverness-shire. This drawing is one of several from Beauly contained in the Hutton Collection. The sheet does not appear to be signed, and may be George Henry Hutton's own work. The engraving on the tombstone shows a human figure, possibly armoured, lying with arms folded over its chest, and a sword or lance to its side. The faint notes on the right hand side of the drawing read 'On the north side of the church, near the east end, but not its original situation - Length 7 feet - Breadth 3 ft. 7inch'. A note on the left hand side of the drawing reveals that the subject of the monument is 'said to be Fraser of Aigas'. Aigas, to the south-west of Beauly, is in the heart of an area traditionally owned by the Clan Fraser..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the remains of a tombstone in Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. A note underneath the sketch reads, 'Stone in the Col. Ch. of Seton, 29 Sept 29 1802. It lies near the East end'. The artist has included measurements and the cruciform design on the stone. A number of other drawings detailing parts of the interior and exterior of the church are also contained in the Hutton Collection. Seton Collegiate Church has an interesting history. Built on the site of a thirteenth-century parish church, it was founded in the late-fifteenth century by the Seton family. Whilst the apse and chancel both date from its foundation, throughout the sixteenth century the church was gradually extended by subsequent generations of the family. Following the death of the fourth Lord Seton at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, his widow, Lady Seton, added the transepts and steeple in memory of her husband..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This was drawn by William Daniell, in 1818, and shows the tomb of Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris, in St Clement's Church, Rodel, Harris. The Hutton Collection contains a number of other drawings and plans’ detailing St Clement’s, including another sketch of Alexander's tomb by Daniell. Alexander Macleod may have built St Clement's Church for the MacLeods of Harris in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century. His nickname was Alexander Crotach, or 'humpback', in recognition of a disfiguring sword wound he received. As Daniell has beautifully illustrated here, Alexander's exquisitely sculpted tomb in St Clement's includes an effigy of a knight, biblical carvings and an inscription..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no text or title with this drawing of an architectural feature at Crossraguel Abbey, Ayrshire but it may be a feature to the north side of the abbey and may even be the gatehouse arch. It is one of two sketches of Crossraguel Abbey in the Hutton Collection and the other is dated 1813. Crossraguel Abbey was a Cluniac house established, in the early 1200s, by the priory at Paisley. It did not receive its charter of confirmation, however, until 1404, from King Robert II. This was a reflection of the abbey's increasing landholdings, power and wealth. Relatively untouched by the Reformation, the abbey eventually fell to the Earl of Cassilis, who tortured the Abbot into signing the abbey and its possessions over to him..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The date of this drawing is October 1800. It is unsigned by the artist, but may be one of Hutton's own drawings. This is one of three views of Fail Monastery in the Hutton Collection. The Monastery is located near the confluence of The Water of Fail and the River Ayr, two miles south-east of Tarbolton. The east view of Fail Monastery shows it in an advanced state of ruin. Trinitarian or Red Friars founded the monastery in 1252 and the Reformation of 1560 partially destroyed it. The Wallace family repaired the buildings after it passed into its ownership, and renamed it, for a time, Fail Castle. It later fell derelict again..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Effigy in Dundrennan Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire. The drawing, which is one of four relating to Dundrennan abbey in the Hutton Collection, reads '7th November 1811' and is unsigned. This effigy appears to be of a robed man lying down. There are two notes relating to it on either side of the title. One reads 'Length abt 5½ Feet'. The other, which appears to identify the subject of the effigy, reads 'Allan Lord of Galloway?' Allan Macdonald, Lord of Galloway (c.1170-1233) was the great-grandson of Fergus, Lord of Galloway (c.1078-1166), who founded Dundrennan Abbey in 1142 for an order of Cistercian monks..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Engraved slab from Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. A note beneath the title on this pencil sketch reads, 'It is near Macdonald's within the ruins of the church'. There is no name attached to this drawing. Unusually there is also no name attached to this, what appears to be, grave marker. The slab shows a large, flat-hilted sword, which is impaling a rabbit. The top quarter of the stone features unspecified designs. Unidentified tombstones marked by plain swords usually denote Knights Templar graves. It is known that the Knights Templar were gifted land in this area during the fourteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, made in October 1811, shows a Latin inscription that appeared on a stone in Annan, Dumfriesshire. A note below the inscription reads, 'Stone in the garden of a house belonging to Mr Haliday [?] at Annan'. The artist is unknown, although it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. On the right side, and underneath the drawing, are the exact measurements of the inscription on the stone. Although it is difficult to decipher the writing, the top line does appear to contain the name of Robert Bruce. Moreover, the date at the end of the inscription is 1300. Given Robert the Bruce's association with Dumfries and the surrounding area, it seems likely that this stone connects to Scotland's ancient king and hero of the Wars of Independence..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows two armorial arms located in the interior of St Andrews Parish Church, Gullane. The artist has also chosen to include an example of the decorative detail from the circular arch. Two further drawings in the Hutton Collection clearly show the two interior arches. St Andrew's Parish Church was built in the twelfth century and abandoned during the early-seventeenth century. The parish church moved to Dirleton in 1612, partly in response to the sandstorms that swept around St Andrews in its exposed and isolated location. Interestingly, the last vicar of St Andrews was apparently removed from his post by King James VI for smoking tobacco!.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Armour on a tombstone at Ardchattan Priory, Argyllshire, 'by Miss Gilbert'. Alex the 6th probably refers to Alexander Campbell, the 6th Laird of Lochinell or Lochnell. This is one of three drawings completed by Miss Gilbert of the area and one ten views of Ardchattan. Ardchattan, still a substantial ruin, houses an impressive collection of craved stones. The earliest of these dates from the 900s and depicts a Celtic cross. Someone later cut it up to serve as a grave cover. Most of the rest of the stones are grave markers from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. After the Reformation, the priory became a parish church with further secular grave stones installed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this drawing of Blantyre Priory and Bothwell Castle, Lanarkshire, the Priory is on the left and the Castle is on top of the hill. This drawing is one of four, which are contained in the Hutton Collection. It conveys the priory's surroundings better than the others do. Although the site of Bothwell Castle was originally in the possession of the Olifard's, it was Walter de Moravia (Moray), who began building work here in 1242. The castle is most famous for its 65 foot diameter Donjon and 15 foot thick walls, dating from the 1270s. Archibald, 3rd Earl of Douglas, acquired the castle and, true to form, invested in further fortifications. The castle finally disappeared in 1926, after losing stone for most of the previous century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no title, artist or date attached to this sheet, but it belongs with another three drawings that depict Blantyre Priory and the River Clyde. The other three all date from the turn of the eighteenth century. The priory is just visible in the copse of trees, and the brickwork was red and so would have been visible. Rather than highlighting this beautiful contrast, the artist has chosen to stylise and blend the priory into its surroundings. Patrick, Earl of Dunbar established the Priory at Blantyre between 1238 and 1249; he was also responsible for founding the Trinitarian complex at Dunbar in 1218. Blantyre was a daughter house of Jedburgh Abbey and was of the Augustinian Order. Patrick's foundation of ecclesiastical houses not only adhered to royal policy, but also directly mimicked royal power and behaviour. His actions represented a sign of loyalty and obedience..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of Blantyre Priory, Lanarkshire by Miss Gilbert, dated 1798. A note is largely illegible, but it appears to talk about the smaller priory remains and the red colour of the bricks. Although labelled the 'Castle', the building in this sketch is the priory, the Castle being a round structure perched on the top of the hill opposite. Drawings of this layout are also contained in the Hutton Collection. Pope Innocent IV officially inaugurated the Augustinian Order in 1244. Although formed of hermits, the main purpose of the order was to live in communal harmony, intent upon the worship and word of God. One of the great four medieval mendicant orders, Augustinians also worked among the lay community. This was often in direct contrast to many of the reclusive and contemplative medieval orders. Blantyre, founded in the mid-thirteenth century, was a daughter house of the abbey at Jedburgh..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Captain Francis Grose made this drawing of the Collegiate Church at Bothwell around 1790. Grose was famous for his drawings of Scottish churches, many of which appeared in his book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland' published in 1791. The first Earl of Douglas founded Bothwell Collegiate Church in October 1398, during the reign of King Robert II of Scotland. The church is one of only two Scottish collegiate churches which were founded before 1400 - the other exception being Dunbar Collegiate Church. Dedicated to St Bride, the church started with a provost and eight prebendaries, and came richly endowed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a south-east view of Brechin Cathedral and its round tower. Drawn in October 1820, this is one of several drawings of the Cathedral in the Hutton Collection. A note below the drawing reads, 'The Maison Dieu is on the north side of the town, in the [lane?] or street called the Vennel, or Maison Dieu Street'. They built Brechin Cathedral in a gothic style with pink sandstone during the thirteenth century, although the building's two surviving round towers date back to the eleventh century. The Pictish round tower is about 1,000 years old and Irish in style. It is the oldest part of the cathedral, probably built by Irish masons. The surrounding graveyard has many interesting gravestones and tombs, many of which commemorate the victims of the plague that decimated the town during the seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the ruins of Coldingham Priory, Berwickshire, which is located in the Scottish Borders, very close to the North Sea coast. The name of the artist has not been included. Edgar, King of Scots, probably founded the church at Coldingham in or around 1098. The church quickly evolved into a priory, inhabited by monks of St Cuthbert from Durham, Northumbria. As with so many of Scotland's church buildings, Coldingham Priory suffered during the Scottish Reformation..</dc:description>

Established as a Cistercian House, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Protestant reformers burnt the building in 1559. All that remains of the original abbey are a few carved and moulded stones and the gatehouse. As was often the case with such ruins, for years the abbey was a quarry for local buildings..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Cullen Collegiate Church and Mercat Cross, Banffshire. This drawing dates from August 1st 1815, but is unsigned, and may be one of Hutton's own works. A note beneath the title reads, 'The Cross is a hexagon. On one of the sides is the Virgin &amp; Babe, on another one the Royal Arms. The other sides are plain. The Cross has been removed since this sketch was made'. Cullen Mercat Cross now stands in the town's main square. The cross has changed location several times, and may date back almost as far as the burgh's original foundation in the twelfth century. Edward I of England may have burnt the first burgh of Cullen, of which no trace now remains, in about 1303. A small community then grew up around Cullen House, seat of the Earl of Findlater, but the modern town centre was developed in the eighteenth century with the growth of the textile industry, and the planned community of Seatown, on the coast, was added when the fishing industry began to boom in the nineteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The sketches show decorative detail from Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. A note at the top of the paper reads, 'Seton Church Communicated by Captain Grose'. In this instance Captain Grose was most likely Francis Grose, the celebrated antiquarian and author of 'The Antiquities of Scotland' (1791). There are several other drawings relating to Seton Church contained in the Hutton Collection. Whilst Seton Collegiate Church was established in the late-fifteenth century, it actually stands on the site of a much earlier parish church dating back to the mid-thirteenth century. Founded by the Seton family, the Collegiate Church was extended by subsequent generations, including the widow of the fourth Lord Seton who was killed during the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Following his death, Lady Seton commissioned the construction of the transepts and steeple..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although the artist has written ‘Midlothian’ on this drawing, Dirleton Castle is in fact in East Lothian. The drawing shows the castle and its environs, including part of the coastline. In the area to the right of the castle, two people, a dog and a small flock of sheep have all been sketched in very faintly. Built in the thirteenth century, the original stone castle consisted of two square towers and four round towers. Throughout the centuries, the castle underwent many changes and alterations, often because of invasion. It was finally abandoned as a residence in the seventeenth century. For many years, stones were gathered from the ruin to build cottages and walls in the local area..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is neither dated nor signed by the artist, and may be the work of George Henry Hutton himself. The fine detail of the carvings shows in the drawings, but there are no notes on the sheet to suggest whether the designs have any particular significance or symbolism. The substantial ruins of Dundrennan Abbey lie among hills several miles south-east of Kirkcudbright. Fergus, Lord of Galloway founded the Abbey in 1142 for an order of Cistercian monks. It became one of the wealthiest in Scotland, owning over 3000 sheep by the late thirteenth century and boasting a booming wool trade. The Reformation in 1560 marked the start of the abbey's decline, and although it appears to have been still thriving when Mary, Queen of Scots stayed there in 1568, by the late seventeenth century the buildings had begun to fall into ruin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is entitled simply, 'Duff House'. The artist has neither signed nor dated it. It is a drawing of Duff House made from the south-east, and looking north-west towards the grand, south-facing front of the house and the church towers and houses of the town of Banff beyond. This is the only image of Duff House contained in the Hutton Collection. Duff House sits in parkland to the south-east of Banff. William Adam designed it for William Duff of Braco, later Earl of Fife, and began building it in 1735, with stone brought by sea from the Firth of Forth. Duff rejected the house, however, and since the eighteenth century, it has served variously as a home, a hotel, a sanatorium, and a prisoner-of-war camp. The National Galleries of Scotland now owns it..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows a significant portion of the castle ruins. The remains of a large archway are clearly defined, as are a number of stone carvings. The artist has also chosen to include significant landmarks located on the horizon, including (from left to right) North Berwick Law, Tantallon Castle and the Bass Rock. Built in the twelfth century and situated on a rocky headland, Dunbar Castle was originally the seat of the Gospatrick family. Due to its coastal location, with the only main route into the castle from the mainland heavily fortified, Dunbar Castle was considered impenetrable. Throughout the centuries, it was the scene of many clashes between the English and the Scots. It is perhaps best remembered as the chosen refuge of Mary, Queen of Scots following the deaths of David Rizzio (1566) and Lord Darnley (1567)..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dated September 1816, shows the east end of Dunbar Collegiate Church. Although the drawing is faint, it offers a valuable record of an important ecclesiastical building that has since disappeared. Founded in the early-fourteenth century by Patrick, 9th Earl of Dunbar, Dunbar Collegiate Church was the first collegiate church to be established in the Lothians, if not in the whole of Scotland - some claim that title for Abernethy Collegiate Church. The building no longer exists and Dunbar Parish Church now stands on the original site. The construction of the parish church commenced around three years after this sketch was completed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows Duniquaich Hill and its watchtower, which overlooks the Argyllshire town of Inveraray. The hill’s name derives from its physical resemblance to a drinking cup, or goblet. Dun means 'hill', while quaich is derived from the Gaelic word 'Cuach', which means 'shallow cup' or in modern terms, a 'drinking cup'. The artist of this drawing is unknown. The town of Inveraray is traditionally the headquarters of the Campbell Clan. The watchtower on the summit of Duniquaich Hill is 700 feet above sea level, and provides an eagle's view of Inveraray, the surrounding countryside and Loch Fyne. Given the history of clan warfare in Scotland and the reputation of the Campbell Clan, a lookout tower would have been an essential requirement for the town..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The titles on these drawings explain that the first two came from the Bishop's Palace in Elgin, and the third from Pluscarden Abbey. All three features come from paintings and depict human figures in various poses. The images may date from 1790. This is one of six images of Pluscarden Priory, founded in 1230 by Alexander II, which together form a comprehensive view of the site in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There are two sheets, which carry depictions of the priory's decorative architecture. This is the only sheet, however, which represents the Bishop's Palace in Elgin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Due to its exposed location and style, the castle was never defendable. This meant that it rarely played a leading role in the politics of power in Scotland. It comprises a fourteenth-century keep, surrounded by a thirteenth-century curtain wall, with fifteenth- and sixteenth-century extensions. Hailes Castle was originally one of the manor houses of the Hepburn family, although after the family's fall at Flodden, it passed through the hands of the Stewarts, Setons and Dalrymples. It also regularly changed hands between English and Scottish administrators. Hailes was transferred to state ownership by the Earl of Balfour in 1924, and the building is now administered by Historic Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the ruins of Innerwick Castle, as viewed from below. The castle, which is strategically positioned on a high rocky outcrop, clearly dominates the surrounding landscape. Also included in the Hutton Collection is a very simplistic drawing of the castle from the same angle: possibly a preliminary sketch by the same artist. Originally built for the Stewart family, Innerwick Castle passed to the Hamiltons before being captured and destroyed by the Duke of Somerset in the mid-sixteenth century. Although the remains of Innerwick Castle are still visible today, in the seventeenth century the ruins suffered a common fate; after being destroyed and abandoned, it was used as a quarry to provide building materials for the local area..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of an inscription in Cullen Collegiate Church, Banffshire, has neither date nor artist’s name. Above the title a transcription of the words that appear on the inscribed arch, probably made by Hutton, is included. The arch appears to be part of a monument in memory of an important local family called Hay. Alexander Ogilvie of Deskford founded Cullen Collegiate Church in 1543 and dedicated it to St Mary, the patron saint of Cullen, whose image also appears on the Mercat Cross. It was one of the latest collegiate foundations in Scotland, coming just two years before the opening of Biggar Collegiate Church, which was the last such establishment in the country. Collegiate churches housed a 'college' of clergy dedicated to Christian learning but also devoted to securing salvation for the church's founders through special masses and prayers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Interior detail, Lincluden Collegiate Church, Dumfriesshire. This sketch shows a detail from 'a window in Lincluden Collegiate Church, near Dumfries. A note following the title reads, The inscription perhaps legible with a glass - 27th Oct. 1811'. There are a number of other drawings detailing Lincluden Collegiate Church contained in the Hutton Collection. Archibald the Grim, 3rd Earl of Douglas, founded Lincluden Collegiate Church, which stands on the site of a Benedictine nunnery, in 1389. It continued, as a college into the late-sixteenth century and after its dissolution became the local quarry. Although much of the stone work disappeared, large parts of the church remain, including much of the chancel and south transept. Importantly, and uniquely in Scotland, the priests' accommodation has survived..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Iona Abbey ruins, Argyllshire. 'From an original sketch made on the spot by W[illia]m Daniell, Esq., A.R.A., July 1st 1815'. More writing reads: ' The little detached ruin is the nunnery'. It would now appear that the building was a chapel and not a nunnery. It is St Oran's Chapel, named for St Columba's cousin and companion. William Daniell (1769-1837) is more famous for his aquatint publication, of the Indian landscape. Between 1786 and 1793, he toured India with his uncle, Tomas, also an artist. Together they travelled further into India than any previous artists. Inspired by the style of William Hodges (1744-97) and the breathtaking scenery, they went on to capture unparalleled images of India's monuments, architecture and landscape. This copy of his abbey painting, however, stands as a testament to a transfer of inspiration and the work he went on to complete in Great Britain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Iona Abbey, Argyllshire, by W. Daniell, Esq., A.R.A., July 1. 1815'. This item is one of nine, which together form a unique record of the many of Iona's monuments. The artist, William Daniell, is more famous for his images of Indian landscape, but his British work covered a longer time span and is of the same quality. The restoration of the abbey ruins began in 1901when funding for a new roof came from public appeal. This had taken two years to organise after the Duke of Argyll gave the site to the Iona Cathedral Trust. This was because of the adverse financial effects of the Boar Wars. It was not until 1938, however, and the establishment of Rev. George F. MacLeod's Iona Community, that further work was completed. Rev. McLeod instigated a cohesive, long-term building plan, eventually completed in 1965..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Kilwinning Abbey, Ayrshire. This drawing is simply entitled 'Kilwinning'. It was drawn about 1789 by Captain Francis Grose, and reproduced in his book 'The Antiquities of Scotland', which was published by Samuel Hooper of London in 1791.This is one of three views of Kilwinning Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection, each by a different artist. St Winning reputedly founded the first church at Kilwinning in Ayrshire in AD 715. The Tironesian Abbey, built in 1162, was an offshoot of Kelso Abbey, but quickly became a highly important ecclesiastical centre in its own right. Like many Scottish abbeys, Kilwinning suffered great structural damage at the hands of Reformers in 1560, although a small part of it became a parish church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows 'Bickerton's Tomb' in the ruins of Luffness Friary, near Aberlady; dated September 1802, it includes descriptive notes at the bottom of the sheet. According to the description, the length of the figure below the arch is around six feet. A shield covers the heart and the remains of a sword are held in the right hand. There is also mention of a stone coffin underneath the figure. The Carmelite monastery at Luffness was founded in the thirteenth century. The land was apparently gifted to the Carmelites by Sir David de Lindsay, who prior to his death was cared for by the members of the order. The tomb in this drawing is said to be that of Sir David, and the stone beneath the figure his coffin..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows one of a number of monuments from Saddell Abbey. The Hutton Collection includes further drawings detailing the famous grave slabs and other monuments found at Saddell. Saddell Abbey is famous for its impressive sculpted stones commemorating the wealthy and powerful lords who were its patrons. For years, people thought of these large stones as coming from Iona and shipped over to Saddell. This has changed, and a carving school probably existed at Saddell Abbey itself..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Part of a memorial inscription in Kilmun Collegiate Church, Argyllshire. George Henry Hutton's note with this drawing reads, 'It is said to have been part of the inscription of the Monument of Sir Duncan Campbell &amp; his wife'. The drawing dates from 5th August 1802, but is unsigned. It is likely, however, that this was one of Hutton's own works. The monument to Sir Duncan Campbell, or the Black Knight of Loch Awe, lay in the vault of Kilmun Collegiate Church, although the fragment drawn here appears to have become separated from the monument and been built into the new parish church of Kilmun. The memorial to Campbell, who founded Kilmun Collegiate Church in 1442, depicts him in full armour lying by the side of his wife..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows Pluscarden Priory from the north-east. It has been copied from a drawing by the Edinburgh-based architect, James Gillespie [Graham], and is dated 1815. According to the note underneath the drawing, the original was in the possession of the Earl of Fife. Sketches of the south-east and north-west views are also contained in the Hutton Collection. Situated around six miles from Elgin, King Alexander II founded Pluscarden Priory in 1230. It was the first of three houses established in Scotland by the Valliscaulian Order, and the only one to receive royal patronage: the other houses were located at Beauly and Ardchattan. As with all Valliscaulian houses, Pluscarden was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist - and uniquely, St Andrew - and had strong links to the mother house at Val des Chouz in Burgundy..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The artist's name is not included anywhere on the picture. This is a clearer illustration than most of the other half-dozen pictures of Restenneth in the Hutton Collection, and gives a better idea of the extent of the ruins. Trees and shrubs to the south partially obscure the building. In this sketch, Restenneth Priory looks much as it does today. The steeple is largely intact, but the roof is missing from the rest of the building, and some walls have crumbled away. Within the main body of the priory, some of the elaborate sculpture and ornamentation on the church walls has survived. The priory is of considerable antiquity. Most of it dates from a twelfth-century Augustinian building, but some parts of the walls are the remains of a Pictish foundation from four or five centuries earlier..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Scotlandwell Friary, Kinross-shire. The drawing reads, 'October 17th, 1789', but is unsigned. It is the only drawing or sketch relating to Scotlandwell in the Hutton Collection. Scotlandwell, to the east of Loch Leven in Kinross-shire, takes its name from the well or spring around which it was built. Trinitarians (also known as Mathurines, or Red Friars) were gifted a hospital, on the site of an earlier Celtic religious foundation, in the thirteenth century. The friars used the spring water to cure various diseases, and Robert the Bruce is reputed to have visited the friary seeking a cure for his leprosy. Today, only the foundations and a few gravestones remain of the friary..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note in the bottom left-hand corner of this drawing reads, 'Collegiate Church of Seton, Haddingtonshire 1781'. It was reproduced in volume I of Captain Francis Grose's famous book, 'The Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1791. Built in the late-fifteenth century and dedicated to St Mary and the Holy Cross, Seton Collegiate Church was founded by the Seton family. It was built on the site of a much earlier parish church, which was incorporated into the present building. It dated from the thirteenth century. Throughout the remainder of fifteenth century and the sixteenth century, subsequent members of the family continued to extend the church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of St Andrew's Church, North Berwick, by James S Richardson, L.L.D. It shows a reconstruction of the church in its heyday. No date is given. Originally built in the twelfth century, the building suffered extensive erosion and was little more than a ruin by the mid-seventeenth century. However, a new site for St Andrew's Church was soon identified close to the town's High Street..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is 'by Capt. Grose from a sketch . . . to me 1789'. It shows the exterior of St Clement's Church at Rodel, Harris, also known as the Church of Rodel. The artist, Captain Grose, is most likely Francis Grose, the celebrated antiquarian and author of 'The Antiquities of Scotland', published in 1791. St Clement's Church was built in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century for the MacLeods of Harris, by Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris. It probably stands on the site of a much earlier church, and may be one of the most impressive buildings in whole of the Western Isles. Although it fell into disuse and disrepair following the Reformation, subsequent years have seen extensive programmes of repair and restoration..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This watercolour copy is from a drawing made on the spot by Captain E. H. Columbine in 1792. It shows the north, now outside, wall of the chapel. The copy is unsigned. The cloisters and administration buildings are behind the chapel, to the south of this view. Reginald, Lord of the Isles, who installed his sister Bethoc as its prioress, founded this nunnery in 1203. The house was of the Augustinian Order. The only other practising Augustinian nunnery in Scotland was in Perth. The nunnery slipped into gradual decline and closed at the Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows St Mary's Collegiate Church and the sixteenth-century Nungate Bridge. It is possibly a copy of an engraving that also forms part of the Hutton Collection. St Mary's Collegiate Church and the Nungate Bridge are two of Haddington's most important landmarks, and both are instantly recognisable to those familiar with the town. The largest parish church in Scotland, St Mary's dates from the fourteenth century and is considered one of the three great pre-Reformation churches of the Lothians: the other two are St Giles in Edinburgh and St Michael's in Linlithgow. The existing Nungate Bridge was built in the sixteenth century, although a bridge has stood in this area since the 1200s..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the town of North Berwick from a distance, with St Mary's Priory on the left, and the impressive form of Berwick Law as a backdrop. Although no date has been attached, it was likely sketched in the early 1780s. The Hutton Collection includes further drawings of St Mary's and of St Andrew's Church in North Berwick. The oldest building in North Berwick, the twelfth-century Cistercian nunnery or priory devoted to the Virgin Mary was one of three Cistercian houses in the Lothians: the other two were Newbattle Abbey, near Dalkeith, and the priory at Haddington. Interestingly, between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, Berwick Law was the property of the nunnery, during which time a beacon was maintained at the summit..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note in the bottom left-hand corner of this drawing reads, 'North Berwick Nunnery 1782'. It shows the remains of St Mary's Priory and part of the coastline around North Berwick, including the Bass Rock. A cow grazing in a nearby field has also been sketched in. There are at least two other drawings or plans relating to St Mary's contained in the Hutton Collection. St Mary's Priory is thought to date from the twelfth century, when it was founded by Duncan, Earl of Fife. It was one of three Cistercian houses in the Lothians: the other two were the priory at Haddington and Newbattle Abbey, near Dalkeith. The Cistercians were also known as 'white monks' due to the white robes they wore. Established in 1098 by St Robert, they were devoted to prayer and physical toil..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tantallon Castle ruins, East Lothian. This view is painted from the interior courtyard of the castle and captures the stunning view the inhabitants would have enjoyed. Most of the building remains date from the fourteenth century, with the overall appearance based on French chateau architecture. Originally, in the possession of the Earls of Fife, Tantallon is now better known as a stronghold of the Douglas family. In 1389, the castle passed to the Earl of Angus, a Red Douglas, but after the tenth Earl died in 1588, the castle fell into disuse. The castle was attacked by both the English and Scottish crowns as the Douglas family changed allegiances and whilst asserting their independence. It was eventually inherited by the Dalrymple family, who gifted it to the state in 1924..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch depicts Terregles Church (alternative name, Terregles Queir) and its graveyard, which is located two miles north-west of Dumfries. Although the name of the artist has not been included on the drawing, it is quite likely to have been George Hutton himself. The parish church at Terregles is especially associated with Lady Agnes Herries, whose burial aisle became part of the church building itself in 1588. The churchyard at Terregles contains many monuments from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and has links with a famous statue of John of Holywood, who was a famous mathematician, astronomer and theologian during the early-thirteenth century. The Hutton Collection contains two drawings of this statue..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This undated drawing shows the Boatsford Stone, which is located in Nithsdale. On the left side of the page can be seen large-sized, magnified drawings, which appear to depict the intricate features that appear on the stone. There does not appear to be much information regarding the Boatsford Stone. The bridge in the background of the drawing, however, suggests that it is located somewhere near the River Nith. The Hutton Collection contains another fine drawing of the stone by Captain Francis Grose dated around 1790, so it could be that this drawing is part of a pair..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Detail of a monument from Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. A note reads, ' /Mr Macalaster of [?] thinks it is a monument of one of the Mackays of [?]'. A further observation on the perspective of the carving is down the other side. It would appear that when viewed from above the figure looks much larger. There is no further information attached to this drawing. This slab is one of many carved stones which are to be found amongst the ruins of Saddell Abbey, and which are now considered to be a treasure-trove of early Scottish art. They are a fantastic pictorial record of the blending of Norse, Celtic and Native cultures along Scotland's west coast..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows Pluscarden Priory from the south-east. It has been copied from a drawing by the Edinburgh-based architect, James Gillespie [Graham], and is dated 1815. According to the note underneath the drawing, the original was in the possession of the Earl of Fife. Founded in 1230 by King Alexander II, Pluscarden Priory is the only medieval monastery in Scotland that still houses monks. Built for members of the Valliscaulian order, they dedicated it to the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist and St Andrew. Pluscarden was the first of three priories established by the order in Scotland: the other two were at Beauly and Ardchattan..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made in 1789 and part of a pair in the Hutton Collection, depicts the ornate stone font of Canonbie Priory. A note below the drawing reads, 'Font once belonging to Canonbie Priory 1789'. Hutton may have made this drawing himself. David I of Scotland founded the Priory at Canonbie during the twelfth century. As can be guessed from the etymology of its name, 'The Town of Canons', Canonbie was a well-known religious centre in the Scottish Borders. Reputedly, Lord Wharton destroyed the priory following the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542, during the 'rough wooing' prelude to the Scottish Reformation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Showing a Franciscan friary in Elgin, Morayshire, from the north-west, this sheet is unsigned, but the drawing appears to be by the same hand as another study of Elgin's Franciscan friary, made from the south-east, that is contained in the Hutton Collection. Both drawings read 'August 1819'. The Franciscan friary, now church, in this drawing still stands intact in Elgin, on a site on Greyfriars Street a little south-east of the High Street and south of the ruins of the medieval cathedral. This was the second Franciscan friary in the town by 1479. The first grew up two centuries earlier on a site a little to the north on South College Street, but it appears to have declined in the late-fourteenth or early-fifteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>One of a number of drawings and sketches from Elgin contained in the Hutton Collection, this view of the former Franciscan friary in Elgin, Morayshire from the south-west, Is dated August 1819, but the name of the artist is not supplied. A Franciscan or 'Grey' friary first appeared in Elgin in the thirteenth century, but despite receiving a grant from David II of Scotland in 1357, it appears to have gone into decline. A second community of Franciscans arrived in 1479 and they erected the friary church depicted in this drawing, which still stands in Elgin today. The church, restored in the nineteenth century, is one of Scotland's best-preserved friary churches..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Made in 1811, this drawing shows the interior of the Franciscan Friary at Dumfries. Central to the drawing is the fireplace and boiling pot, with cooking and fire-starting utensils hanging on the wall at the top of the sketch. The name of the artist has not been included. Lady Devorgilla, daughter of the Lord of Galloway, founded Dumfries Friary in or around 1262. Also known as, Greyfriars, the Convent stands in a beautiful spot in Dumfries, overlooking the River Nith. Rumour has it that the friary is the location where Robert the Bruce killed Red Comyn, thus causing the start of the Scottish Wars of Independence..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch shows the King's Cave, which is located on the shoreline close to the seaside town of Ayr. The date given is October 1811. The artist is unknown, although it is quite likely to have been Hutton himself. This cave is commonly confused with the King's Cave on the Isle of Arran, which is where Robert the Bruce is reputed to have watched the indefatigable spider. Another famous cave in the sandstone cliffs near Ayr is Peden's Cave, where the Covenanter, Alexander Peden, gave sermons to his congregation. Local legend has it that this cave is where Robert Burns parted from Mary Campbell, after pledging his love for her..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of Main square, Lauder, Berwickshire, is undated, and unsigned by the artist. This is the only image of Lauder in the Hutton Collection. In this drawing, the Town Hall or Tollbooth of Lauder is in the foreground, to the left. The artist has given a strong impression of the manner in which the distinctive building, with its steeple and entrance at the top of a flight of broad steps, dominates the square at the centre of Lauder. The church, built in 1673, is behind the Tollbooth, slightly left of centre, and is a very distinctive building. Its design has the body of the church laid out in a Greek Cross shape around a central pulpit, and the bell-tower octagonal in form and built above the centre point of the church, and is unique in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Of the Maison Dieu Chapel in Brechin, Angus, this faint drawing, made in 1814, shows its south-west view. A note at the bottom of the drawing provides the audience with some historical information about the ruined chapel. The term, Maison Dieu, is French for 'The House of God'. The Maison Dieu Chapel originally belonged to a medieval hospital, founded in 1267 by Lord William de Brechin. Little now remains of this alms house, although an ambry (a recess in a church wall for holding e.g. sacramental vessels), some finely-detailed doors and a few Gothic window frames are in the drawing..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawing of North and east sides of a pillar at Deadrig, Berwickshire. It is dated 1785 but is unsigned by the artist. A later hand has added a note, which reads 'AND E Sides'. This is one of two views of the pillar at Deadrig, both apparently by the same hand. The designs carved on this pillar suggest that it is a memorial to someone. On the side most clearly drawn, directly beneath the cross at the head of the pillar, there is an image of a man, with arms crossed over his chest in the manner of someone who at rest. Beneath this, there is a picture of an animal, perhaps a hunting dog, maybe buried with its master..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, probably by George Hutton, is dated August 8th 1815. There are a number of drawings of the abbey in Hutton's collection, as well as a plan by Andrew Nisbet. Kinloss Abbey lies 3 miles north-east of Forres. Dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, King David I founded the Abbey in 1150 when the monks of the Cistercian Order inhabited it. It received its Papal Bull from Pope Alexander III in 1174 and came under the protection of the Bishop of Moray in 1187. It ceased to be an active monastery in the mid-seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing does not carry a title, but it depicts the smaller, northern section of a ground-plan of Coupar Angus Abbey, Perthshire. It was drawn over two pages by a mason from Coupar Angus named as John Mitchell here, but as William Mitchell on another drawing in the Hutton Collection. The date on the page containing the southern section is December 1820. We do not know whether Mitchell drew the plan by copying an earlier existing plan, or whether he made an archaeological study of the foundations of the abbey. The plan shows many features of the abbey that did not exist by the time Hutton was building up his collection. The abbey appears surrounded by a wall named 'Agricola's Wall', probably after the Roman Governor who led an invasion of Scotland about AD 80. As well as providing the outlines of the walls of the various buildings in the abbey complex, the plan also suggests that there were castellated gate-houses on each of the walls. One of these is all that was left standing after Protestant reformers burnt the Abbey in 1559. Locals then dismantled it for building materials..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of the north-west view of Pluscarden Priory, Moray. A note explains how the original drawing was the work of James Gilliespie and the Earl of Fife was the keeper. The note, however, does not clarify who completed this copy, but it is dated 1815. We know more about Pluscarden Priory's garden than the establishment itself. Monastic houses, as medieval centres of learning, were closely associated with medicine and horticulture. As such, they kept wide-ranging and often exotic herb and pleasure gardens. All three of the Valliscaulian establishments founded in Scotland enjoyed an impressive reputation for the quality of their garden enclosures..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The artist has sketched the remains of a nunnery at Haddington, which by 1784 appears to have been little more than a stone vault. A general impression of the surrounding area, including two buildings, has also been provided. The nunnery was founded in 1178 and was one of three Cistercian houses in the Lothians: the other two being Newbattle Abbey, near Dalkeith, and the nunnery at North Berwick. The Cistercians were also known as the 'white monks' because of the simple white robes they wore. Strictly vegetarian, they divided their days between prayer and physical work that included tending their gardens and orchards..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The artist, of this undated drawing of the Ogilvie Monument in St. Mary’s Church, Banff, was 'W. Hay', and was probably William Hay, who drew other works in the Hutton Collection. The drawing gives a detailed impression of a monument, consisting of two decorative inscribed panels sculpted from the stone wall under a window in the church. It is one of four images relating to St Mary's Church in the collection. The inscription on the monument reveals that it is in memory of Walter Ogilvy of Dunlugus, Lord Banff, who died in 1558, and his wife Alison Hume, who died in 1557. The lower panel, which dates from 1580, commemorates George Ogilvy, who was probably Walter Ogilvy's son. The Ogilvie family of Banff were a branch of one of Scotland's most prominent noble families, headed by the Earl of Airlie, and later acquired the Earldoms of Findlater and Seafield..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the famous Auld Brig that crosses over the River Ayr in the town of Ayr. The drawing is unsigned. Reputedly built in 1236, the Auld Brig of Ayr is the main subject of Robert Burns’ poem, 'The Brigs of Ayr'. Simpson's was the name of a noted tavern at one end of the bridge, and Burns mentions this locally famous pub in his poem. Local legend has it that two maiden sisters provided the money to build the bridge. A number of people had drowned at this point of the river and so they resolved to have a bridge constructed..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Beneath the title, of this drawing of the old tower of Kilwinning Abbey, Ayrshire, a note, probably by Hutton, reads, 'Comd. by the Revd. Mr Stirling, Minr. Of Port Monteath'. This is one of three images of Kilwinning Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection, each by a different artist. The Reformation of 1560 destroyed much of the medieval abbey at Kilwinning, but the central tower, similar in appearance to that of Glasgow Cathedral, stood until 1814, when it collapsed after a lightning strike had weakened its structure. The phrase 'as it stood' in Hutton's title indicates that he received, or at least titled, before a new tower appeared in 1816..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a panoramic view of Kinloss Abbey, Moray and the surrounding area. A note goes on to explain that the Abbot's Lodging, the dormitory and the north wall of the Chapter House are all visible. The highest tower in the image is the south transept of this cruciform plan church: very little else of the complex remains, however, as Alexander Brodie stripped it for profit in 1650, who then sold the stone to Oliver Cromwell. David I originally founded the abbey in 1150 as a Cistercian house. David I pursued a vigorous and well-rounded religious policy, which resulted in the appearance of many monastic houses in Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the remains of St Mary's Church, Banff, from the south-west. The artist was William Hay, who contributed two other drawings of St Mary's Church to the Hutton Collection. The ruins of St Mary's Church lie close to the mouth of the River Deveron, south-east of the sea-town but close to the heart of the medieval town of Banff. The church dates from 1471, and became the burial place for the Ogilvie family of Banff, a branch of a prominent Scottish noble family. Much of the church was demolished in 1797 apart from the south aisle, above the Ogilvy burial vault. The churchyard is remarkable for its unusual sculpted gravestones..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sheet, dated September 6th 1815, is unsigned by the artist, but it is quite likely that this is one of Hutton's own drawings. A note below the title gives approximate dimensions of the remains: 'External length about 30 paces - Breadth, 9'. This is the only drawing or sketch from Spittal contained in the Hutton Collection. The ruined hospital and chapel of St Magnus lies on the western slopes of Spittal Hill, about 3 miles south-south-east of the town of Halkirk in Caithness. The building is reputed to date from the twelfth century, and its grounds were the burial place of the Clan Gunn until the early twentieth century. St Magnus was the Earl of half of Orkney, killed by his cousin, and fellow earl, Haakon Paulson, in about AD 1116 or 1117. Magnus is the patron saint of Caithness, Orkney and Shetland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is the second drawing by Miss Gilbert, with a note down one side of the sheet. This tells of the remodelling of the Priory for secular use in both in 1620 and in 1713. Duncan MacDougall founded Ardchattan in 1230 as a house of the Valliscaulian Order. He was also responsible for establishing the stronghold and power centre at Dunstaffinage Castle. Ardchattan was only one of three Valliscaulian monasteries in Scotland, the other two being Pluscarden and Beauly. Pluscarden was the only establishment to enjoy royal patronage, the other two being associated with lay-lords. After the Reformation, the buildings became the property of the Lords of Lochniell or Lochnell..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of the ruins of Coupar Angus Abbey, Perthshire and much of the surrounding area. The artist has written 'tollbooth' in the foreground, suggesting that this view is from outside the tollbooth. A number of other drawings and plans in the Hutton Collection also detail the Abbey and its environs. Founded in the mid-twelfth century by King Malcolm IV, Coupar Angus Abbey was home to members of the Cistercian Order. Also known as, 'white monks', due to their simple robes, the Cistercians chose an austere existence, dividing their time between prayers and working the land. The monks at Coupar Angus Abbey successfully traded wool with continental Europe..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of several unsigned studies of the remains of Coupar Angus Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection. The abbey is located just to the south-east of the town centre, off the main road to Dundee. The only surviving part of Coupar Angus Abbey is a gate-house, and the drawings in the Hutton Collection suggest that this has been the case since at least the late-eighteenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of several drawings of the Abbey contained in the Hutton Collection, but the artist's name is not given. Here the artist is looking south-west towards the entrance of a gate-house, which is the only surviving part of the abbey. Coupar Angus Abbey, built between 1161 and 1164, stands on land gifted by King Malcolm IV to a group of Cistercian monks from Melrose. By the mid-sixteenth century, it was the wealthiest Cistercian monastery in Scotland but, in 1559, a Reformist mob burnt its buildings. Over the years, the remains were broken up for building material, until only one gate-house remained..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The text underneath reads, 'The sketch shows the ruins of the Conventual Church'. It records deteriorated walls, with arches and niches cut into them - all covered with lush under growth and ivy. Both the archaeological and documentary history of the Ardchattan site remains quite fragmented and inconclusive. The Priory came into being in 1230 as a house of the Valliscaulian Order but over the next 500 years the monastery, private housing and the parish church all existed here..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although there is no date attached to this sheet, it is one of a series of twelve others, labelled 1815. This image shows two decorated, arched and recessed niches in the interior south wall. The north transept is now the only part of the extant building remains which is intact. This, however, is due to the redesigning and rebuilding work completed by Alexander Ross in 1901. At this time, this area became the private burial space of the Mackenzie family. It is useful therefore to have this much earlier image as it preserves how the original ruins would once have looked..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>No title appears underneath this picture, of the south and east sides of a pillar at Deadrig, Berwickshire. Instead, it is on the base of the pillar, as if it was one of the inscriptions. At the bottom of the sheet, a note explains that the drawing shows the south and west sides of the pillar. Another drawing by the same hand in the Hutton Collection shows the north and east sides. This pillar probably commemorates a warrior from near Deadrig. On one of the sides of the pillar, obscured in this drawing, there is an engraving of a man, apparently laid to rest. The sword in this drawing suggests that this was a man accustomed to fighting in battle. It is not possible from this picture to estimate the age or origins of the cross..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a view of the south side of Restenneth Priory, Angus. The name of the artist is missing but it is likely that it was one of Hutton's own drawings. It is one of a number of drawings of Restenneth Priory, from different perspectives in the collection. In this view, trees and shrubs in the foreground obscure the building, but it is clear that while much of the priory is ruined, the steeple remains largely intact. Restenneth Priory lies about two miles east of Forfar, on the main road to Montrose. No one knows its exact origins, but the first ecclesiastical building on the site might have been a foundation by Picts in the seventh or early eighth century, and some Pictish stonework still exists in the remains of the priory. In the twelfth century, it was a cell of Augustinian canons..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this drawing of the south view of Blantyre Priory, Lanarkshire, The priory is in the centre of a thicket, which conveys the beauty of the setting. This is one of four drawings of Blantyre. Together they make a comprehensive record of the buildings and landscape at the turn of the eighteenth century. There are very little structural remains of the priory now left and so it is difficult to reconstruct the architecture of the site. However, it would have been extensive, incorporating both enclosed ecclesiastical buildings and space for lay interaction. The buildings were of fine-grained red sandstone and there were herbal and contemplative gardens. Although difficult to prove, perhaps Marie de Coucy brought masons from her home chateau in France to work on the priory and the castle..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This light pencil drawing, dated August 1815, shows the south-east view of Pluscarden Priory. The artist has drawn it from a considerable distance and provided an impression of the surrounding countryside, including fields, trees and, in the background, what is very possibly Heldon Hill. Founded by King Alexander II in 1230, Pluscarden Priory was one of three houses established by the Valliscaulian Order in Scotland: the other two being Beauly and Ardchattan. As with many ecclesiastical buildings, Pluscarden Priory fell into disrepair following the Reformation. At the end of the nineteenth century, a programme of restoration and rebuilding took place and, in 1943, Benedictine monks of Prinknash Abbey took ownership. Monastic life recommenced in the priory in 1948, and in 1974 Pluscarden was elevated to the status of an abbey..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is the southern section of a ground-plan of Coupar Angus Abbey, Perthshire. A note by Hutton at the bottom of the sheet reads 'Copied from a Plan [comd.] by Mr John Mitchell, Cupar in Angus, Decr. 1820'. Mitchell is referred to by Hutton as 'William' on another drawing in the collection, so doubt remains over which was his real name. The plan is over two pages and this, the southern section, is the larger of the two parts. By the time, Hutton visited Coupar Angus, all that remained standing of the abbey was a gate-house: Protestant reformers burnt the rest in 1559 and locals plundered its ruins for building stone. However, the floor plans shown here contain details of the entire abbey. Hutton's note does not make clear whether Mitchell's drew his plan from older existing plans or from an archaeological study of the abbey's foundations..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>One of a pair included in the Hutton Collection, this drawing shows the elaborate stone font of Canonbie Priory. A note below the drawing reads, 'Font which belonged to Canonbie Priory in Eskdale, Drawn 1789'. Again, Hutton may have drawn this. Fonts became commonplace in Scottish churches during the sixth century, and were generally used for baptising purposes, as the word means 'spring'. Inhabited by monks of the Augustinian Order, David I of Scotland founded the Priory during the twelfth century. Canonbie's name means 'The Town of Canons', and the priory was a famous religious centre in the Scottish Borders during the medieval era. Lord Wharton may have destroyed the priory in 1542, after the Battle of Solway Moss..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tower of Kilmun Collegiate Church, Argyllshire. This drawing dates from August 1802, but is unsigned. The drawing depicts the square tower at Kilmun, which is the only remaining part of a collegiate church founded in 1442 by Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochawe, Chief of the Clan Campbell and ancestor of the Dukes of Argyll. The body of water in the background is the Holy Loch. Collegiate churches in Scotland were largely a phenomenon of the fifteenth century. Usually they sit on the sites of existing churches that had been under the patronage of a particular family or individual. Although the collegiate churches were places of Christian learning for a 'college' of clergy, they were also dedicated to holding masses and prayers for the salvation of their patrons' souls..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title under these pencil sketches reads, 'Part of a Cross at Sadael Abbey'. The note goes on to clarify the fragments, position to the north-east of the church. The three sketches incorporate armour, ships and decorative motifs. Latin script is also in evidence around the frame of the slivers. The stones at Saddell are a treasure-trove of early Scottish artistry and hold much social and political information in their symbolism. We now believe that there was a school of carving based here, who were responsible for many of these stones. There is only one cross-stone represented amongst the stones, details of which you can see here. The Romano-Celtic interlacing especially demonstrates the intermingling of Irish, Norse and Southern cultures, prevalent in west Scotland at this time.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Three features from Pluscarden Priory, Moray. Part of the writing above these pencil sketches reads, 'From a drawing in Captain Grose's possession'. As indicated, this is a copy of an original drawing although there are no artists' names or original dates attached to the sheet. Of the three drawings, two are of human figures and the third is a sun, moon and stars motif. King Alexander II founded Pluscarden Priory in 1230, as a house of the Valliscaulian Order. That same year, lay-lords established two other Valliscaulian houses at Ardchattan and Beauly..</dc:description>

The plan is not contained in the Hutton Collection. Another note at the bottom of the drawing suggests that the stones are not in their original location. Founded in the thirteenth century by Duncan MacDougall, Ardchattan Priory was home to members of the Valliscaulian Order: other Valliscaulian houses were Beauly and Pluscarden. Monks remained at Ardchattan until the mid-sixteenth century, after which the priory and its grounds belonged to the Campbell family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A note reveals the location of the second stone and the information it relates about the death of the Prior around 1500. This stone has Latin script and a beautiful decorative panel. The first stone on the sheet is a representation of a mail-clad warrior. Early medieval carved stones are common in the western Scottish landscape and were a popular method of denoting power and status. There were four or five master schools of carving dotted around the west of Scotland; examples from the school at Saddell are also in the Hutton Collection. Decorative motifs, displaying Celtic, Norse and Romanesque influences, life-size warrior representations, armour and ships are all popular as themes for carvings..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This picture, of windows and an inscribed arch in Cullen Collegiate Church, Banffshire, is undated and unsigned. A transcription of the text on the inscribed arch, probably made by Hutton, is included in a note above the title. The words appear to be in Scots. The exact meaning of the inscription is hard to decipher, but may refer to a croft of 35 acres, and someone who is a good singer of holy songs. It advises the reader to pray for Ellen Hay. This church, founded in 1543, was one of the last collegiate churches in Scotland. One of the primary functions of collegiate churches was to offer special prayers and masses for the souls of the founders of the church, and those close to them. Alexander Ogilvie of Deskford founded Cullen Collegiate Church, but Ellen Hay and John Hay, whose names appear on more than one inscription in the church, may have been associated in some way with Ogilvie or with the church, and might therefore have been among those prayed for by the college of resident clergy..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the exterior of the church and part of the surrounding area. Two figures are standing in front of the building. The Hutton Collection also includes two further drawings relating to Tongland, both of which detail early sculptured stones. The village of Tongland lies within the parish of the same name, in Dumfriesshire, and is near the River Dee, two miles north of Kirkcudbright. Interestingly, it erected a new parish church in 1813, approximately one year after this drawing. The drawing appears to be of the earlier church, the remains of which stand in the present-day kirkyard..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dated 7th August 1815, shows a rural view of Kinloss Abbey. In the foreground, a rider allows his horse to graze beside a stone bridge, which arches gracefully over a small river. It also shows Nelson's Pillar near Forres. King David I of Scotland founded Kinloss Abbey in 1150. For 500 years, the monks of the Cistercian Order occupied it, until 1650 when Alexander Brodie systematically demolished it and sold the stone to Oliver Cromwell. Still regarded as an important part of their culture and history by the residents of Kinloss, they marked the 850th anniversary of the monastery's founding in 2001. Nelson's Tower, on the top of Cluny Hill, Forres, was built as a memorial to Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1806..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, dating from 1802, shows three armorial bearings located in the interior of Seton Collegiate Church, East Lothian. The artist has also provided descriptive notes detailing some of the key features of the church, including monumental arches and several coats of arms. Interestingly, it has been recorded that the west part of the church was never completed. A note under one of the armorial bearings suggests that it is 'Probably emblematic of the grief of the Lady Seton, whose Lord was slain at Flodden'. The fifth Lord Seton, whose family was responsible for the construction of Seton Collegiate Church in the late-fifteenth century, was indeed killed on the battlefield at Flodden in 1513..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There is no artist or date attached to this sheet of six drawings of individual features found in Crossraguel Abbey, Ayrshire but two other pencil sketches from this abbey date from 1813. The first three sketches at the top of the sheet depict human heads: the remaining three are of stylised animals. All of these carvings come from the tops of pillars. Duncan, Earl of Carrick established Crossraguel Abbey in 1216, as a Cluniac house, It now boasts some of the best preserved Cluniac architectural remains, with the Chapter House and Chapel especially standing almost intact..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The upper drawing on this page is entitled 'Elevation', and shows the north side of the church. The height of the tower measures 60 feet and the length of the building from east to west, 83 feet. The lower drawing is entitled 'The ground Plan with the Tombs'. The measurements of individual walls, doors and windows are missing but, at the foot of the page, the artist has included a scale in feet 'from which the Dimensions and Proportions may be known'. These drawings are two of several relating to St Clement's Church in the Hutton Collection. The artist's identity is unknown. St Clement's Church dates from the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century, and is one of the oldest surviving cruciform churches in Scotland. It was only in use for a short period before the Reformation, after which it was derelict for long periods, and even served as a cow byre. Other restoration projects have happened since..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Drawn ground-plan of St Clement's Church, Harris, Inverness-shire. It dates from July 4th 1818, has the initials 'H.D'. As well as giving the measurements of the church's walls and floor space, the plan also notes the positioning of windows, monuments and the pulpit. This one of a number of drawings made of St Clement's Church that is contained in the Hutton Collection. St Clement's Church in Rodel, South Harris, may date from the fifteenth or early sixteenth century, and stands on the site of an earlier ecclesiastical building. It is one of the oldest cruciform churches in Scotland, and one of the grandest buildings in the Hebrides, but fell into disuse after the Reformation of 1560. The church, restored by Captain Alexander Macleod of Berneray in 1784, had again fallen into disrepair by the mid-nineteenth century and was in use as a cow byre. The Countess of Dunmore began the modern restoration of the building in 1873..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A plan of the route of a Roman road in Angus and Aberdeenshire, the artist was 'Joan' Jamieson and the date of the engraving 1785. A handwritten note at the top of the sheet reads 'Gough's Camden, Vol. 3 Pl. 30'. This gives the source of the plate as Richard Gough's 1789 translation of 'Britannia', written by the historian and antiquary William Camden and first published in 1586. The road shown here was probably the main Roman route north, although the artist's geography does not correspond with modern thinking on Roman Scotland. The camp of Battledykes was slightly north of Forfar, while 'Haerfauds' was probably Hallforest, near Kintore on the south bank of the River Don..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This detailed engraving shows Brechin Cathedral with its round tower. The surrounding shrubbery provides a natural frame for the Cathedral. This is one of several drawings of the Cathedral, with its round tower, that appear in the Hutton Collection. The engraving has neither date nor signature, although it is likely that the artist was Hutton himself. Originally a stand-alone building, the round tower was incorporated into the cathedral when the church was built during the thirteenth century. Built in an Irish style, Irish masons probably constructed the Pictish Round Tower in about 1150. The Cathedral's interior boasts some fine Pictish carvings and excellent stained-glass windows, while the ancient graveyard contains many of the victims who died in the terrible plague of the mid-seventeenth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is an undated engraving of Dunglass Castle, Dunbartonshire. A note below the title, says the artist is a 'Mr Woodyer', and that he based the engraving on a drawing by 'Mr Sandby'. This is probably a reference to Paul Sandby (1731-1809). He was an English topographical draughtsman whose work remains highly collectable. Dunglass Castle stands on a craggy promontory overlooking the River Clyde, near its confluence with the Leven in Dunbartonshire; the original castle, of which little remains, dated from around 1380, and was owned by the Colquhoun family. A later castle, built on the same site, was, for a time, owned by the family of Margaret Macdonald, the artist wife of Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Another Dunglass Castle also once existed in Scotland, near the hamlet of the same name in East Lothian, but disappeared around 1640..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving, one of a pair in the Hutton Collection relating to the Hebridean island of Staffa, shows the approach to Fingal's Cave. While the other engraving records the strange volcanic patterns of the island's hexagonal rock formations in close-up, this engraving shows the front of Fingal's Cave, and the vertical basalt columns that dominate Staffa's profile. At the foot of the pillars are the hexagonal stones that form a path of natural, honeycomb-like stepping-stones into the cave's entrance. There is no date for this engraving and the artist is unknown. Fingals' Cave uncanny resemblance to a large cathedral would have appealed to Hutton, as he gathered artwork and writings relating to the history of Scotland's ecclesiastical buildings. Hutton was not the only early nineteenth century artist who was greatly inspired by the amazing rock formations on Staffa. In addition to the composer, Felix Mendelssohn, and the painter, William Turner, Sir Walter Scott also visited the island and used Fingal's Cave as an inspirational muse, as did the Romantic poets, Keats and Wordsworth. Fingal is a famous character from Celtic mythology..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is another mounted engraving by J.B., the artist, and R. Scott, the engraver. There is no date. The image contains representations of contemporary islanders and island life. St Columba, fleeing political problems in Ireland, landed on Iona in 563 and established a monastic community. The island still has many historically significant buildings, many of which were monastic dwellings. The Hutton Collection features nine views of these monuments..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving shows St Mary's Collegiate Church and the Nungate Bridge. The artist has also chosen to detail much of the surrounding area, and has included part of the town and two men fishing on the banks of the River Tyne. The artist's name and the date have not been included. Several other drawings of St Mary's also form part of the Hutton Collection, including one that has very possibly been copied from this engraving. Situated in the south-east of Haddington, St Mary's Collegiate Church stands on the west bank of the River Tyne. A medieval cruciform church, it was built in the fourteenth century - completed in the fifteenth - and is decorated with typical medieval stone carvings, including green men and scallops. Almost 100 years after completion, St Mary's suffered extensive damage during the Siege of Haddington (1548-9). Although partial restoration work was carried out in the decades that immediately followed, it was not until the 1970s that the building was fully restored..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This engraving shows the cathedral-like entrance and inner sanctum of Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean island of Staffa. The archway entrance to Fingal's Cave has vertical columns of basalt, while inside the cave is luminous floor of water. The 'Pillar Island' was popular with artists, writers and musicians during the nineteenth century, and was the inspiration for Felix Mendelssohn's overture, 'The Hebrides', as well as some of William Turner's most famous paintings. There is no date for this engraving and the artist is unknown. The entrance to Fingal's Cave is composed of a network of hexagonal-shaped rocks - just like a honeycomb, formed during volcanic activity. These hexagonal rocks are very similar to stepping-stones, which is why the Giant's Causeway, near Coleraine in Northern Ireland, might be the other half of Fingal's Cave - hence Staffa's place in Celtic mythology..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There are two names contained inside the mounting frame of this engraving – ‘J.B., Esq, del.’, i.e. drew it, and ‘R. Scott, sculpt.’, i.e. engraved it. There is no date. This drawing illustrates the view to the south-west. The island of Iona, a long, relatively flat lying outcrop, is dominated by the now rebuilt, Iona Abbey. One of the few intact pieces of masonry seems to have been the bell tower. From the eight other images found in the Hutton Collection this feature always seems to have been the focal point of the island's skyline. There are at least three other monastic buildings still standing today which are associated with pre-Reformation religion on the island..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Formal ground-plan of Beauly Priory, Inverness-shire. A very faint note at the bottom of the plan reads 'Recd. from L .Col Marr, 9 July 1825'. The creator of the plan is not noted, but it was clearly someone with some formal training as a draughtsman. This is one of a number of drawings and sketches from Beauly contained in the Hutton Collection. The note beneath the title reads, 'On the South side of the church between the West end and the front door to the east appear the vestiges of a building which had been attached to the wall of the church. It had probably been only a small dwelling house erected there after the destruction of the priory. All the buttresses have fallen from the walls. Their situations are dotted. The South Aisle said to have been the Burial Place of the Family of Bain of Tulloch'. Other notes on the plan describe the locations of windows and monuments in the priory, and the dimensions of the building..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This formal ground-plan of St Mary's Church, Banff, Banffshire, is one of four views of this church contained in the Hutton Collection. The sheet is not dated, but the artist, from the name in the bottom right corner, appears to have been William Hay. The plan has a very professional appearance, and it seems likely that Hay had some formal training as a draughtsman. St Mary's Church in Banff dates from 1471 and was simple in form. The main church was a rectangle, with a short aisle and an entrance porch extending from the south wall. The details of Hay's plan are quite sparse, and do not include the locations of windows, pulpit or choir. However, he does mark the existence of three monuments within the church. These are in memory of Sir Walter Ogilvy, the Rev. Alexander Seaton, and Provost Baird..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Inscription from a tomb in Lincluden Collegiate Church. This sketch shows the simple outline of a monument located in Lincluden Collegiate Church, near Dumfries. The artist has transcribed the inscription that appears on the tomb and has provided useful notes: 'Lincluden 5 July 1807. At the East end, on the right of the great window, is an angel with an inscription, but the little that remains of it is not now legible. Prof. Stuart thinks the letters at the top are probably contractions for [...]'.. '. The words indicate that the tomb is that of Margaret, wife of Archibald, 4th Earl of Douglas, and daughter of King Robert III. Her husband, Archibald may have added the chancel, in which Margaret's tomb is located. Archibald the Grim, 3rd Earl of Douglas, Margaret's father-in-law, founded the Church in 1389. He chose to build it on a site previously occupied by a Benedictine nunnery..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Inscription from Alexander MacLeod's tomb, St Clement's Church, Harris, Inverness-shire. This inscription comes from the tomb of Alexander MacLeod, which is located in the south-eastern part of St Clement's Church, Rodel, Harris. William Daniell, who also sketched the tomb itself, transcribed it in 1818, Daniell's two drawings of the monument, and the transcription seen here, are contained in the Hutton Collection, along with a number of other drawings and plans relating to St Clement's Church. William Daniell's drawings of Alexander MacLeod's tomb beautifully illustrate the impressive biblical carvings that adorn it. A ship, a castle and a hunting scene are on the stone and the effigy of a medieval knight protects MacLeod’s stone coffin. Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris is believed to have built St Clement's in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century on the site of a much earlier church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Inscription from monument, St Clement's Church, Harris, Western Isles. This inscription comes from a funerary monument located in the south aisle of St Clement's Church, Rodel, Harris. William Daniell, who also sketched the tomb itself, transcribed it, in 1818. Both the drawing of the monument and the transcription are contained in the Hutton Collection, along with a number of other drawings and plans relating to St Clement's Church. It is believed that Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan and Harris built St Clement's in the late-fifteenth or early-sixteenth century on the site of a much earlier church. The funerary monument that this inscription appears on possibly belongs to William MacLeod, Alexander's son. William succeeded as clan leader following his father's death, and both men have graves in the church. Alexander's tomb in particular has exquisite examples of medieval sculpture..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Interior view of Beauly Priory, Ross-shire [Subtitle:]. The title of this drawing reads, 'The Priory Church of Beaulieu in Rosshire - drawn from the East end looking West. Aug 1815'. It shows the interior of the ruined priory at Beauly, with a solitary figure seated on a central stone slab. The artist has included notes beneath the drawing detailing some of the deterioration. Also contained in the Hutton Collection are exterior views of the south, south-west and north-east. John Bisset founded Beauly Priory in 1230 as a house for the Valliscaulian Order. It was one of three houses established in Scotland by the order at this time; the others were located at Pluscarden and Ardchattan. Beauly Priory remained a Valliscaulian house until the early-sixteenth century, at which time it changed its allegiance to the Cistercian Order. Whilst parts of the complex lie in ruins or have disappeared over the years, the MacKenzies rebuilt the north transept in 1901 to serve as a mausoleum for the family..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a page of a letter from M Green to Mr Urban incorporating a sketch of Iona Abbey. The sketch says it is by 'Lilliman, Oct. 1761'. The letter discusses the illustrations in certain volumes of books and the lack of a schoolmaster on Iona. The whole is an extract from the 'Gentleman's Magazine' published in July 1793 (Volume 1 xiii). This sketch was to be an illustration in one of these volumes. This illustration is one of nine views of Iona contained in the Hutton Collection. This view of Iona is a little more unusual as it is contained on an extracted letter. The other views are mainly copies of whole paintings and drawings. The views cover a wide date range - about 75 years - and illustrate many of the island's religious features..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This map is dated 1790 and was drawn by Thomas Cocking. Cocking assisted Captain Francis Grose (1731-91), whose illustrations feature significantly in the Hutton Collection. This is the only image relating specifically to the town of Kirkcudbright in the collection, although there are others relating to separate sites in Kirkcudbrightshire. Although Cocking's map dates from 1790, it shows that Kirkcudbright had not grown much beyond the medieval town centre that existed in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The street running from east to west is 'High Street', and the street that runs north from the west end of the High Street is Castle Street. This leads to the castle and parish church, which are both annotated on the map. The page also includes a larger-scale plan of Castledykes Hill, which stands west of the town overlooking the River Dee..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This light pencil sketch shows the north-east view of Beauly Priory. It dates from 25th August 1815 and includes a note of the location underneath the drawing. Interestingly, the artist has used the French spelling of Beauly, 'Beau Lieu'. Much of the surrounding area has also been sketched, including fields, trees, and a number of people who appear to be watching sailing vessels on Beauly River. The Hutton Collection also includes drawings of the south view and south-west view. It has been suggested that the name Beauly originates from the French 'beau lieu', meaning 'beautiful place'. During a visit to the priory in 1564, Mary, Queen of Scots is purported to have admired the area and described it as the 'beau lieu'. However, the name could date from an even earlier time. When Valliscaulian monks arrived in the 1230s, they liked what they saw so much that they described it as 'Prioratus de Bello Loco' or 'Priory of the Lovely Spot'!.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Note describing the bells from Holywood Abbey, Dumfriesshire. This short descriptive note relates to two drawings of church bells, which are also included in the Hutton Collection. The two bells, taken from the ruins of Holywood Abbey, near Dumfries, are now in the village's parish church. Although the identity of the writer is unknown, this note says '1811'. The note reads: 'The bell is 19 inches high and measures round the mouth 54 inches, and round the inscription 31 ½ inches. The above are the dimensions of the bell which has the inscription, the other bell being one inch higher &amp; one inch wider round'. Built in the English Gothic style, monks of the Premonstratensian Order probably founded Holywood Abbey around 1180. Sadly, only a few ruins now remain..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This fragment of writing, on Kilmartin, Argyllshire, may once have been a description of now missing picture. The note, which appears to be in Hutton's handwriting, reads 'Mr Daniell informed me that several years ago (probably about 25) a great many coins were found in the excavation in the centre of the druidical circle, which were afterwards distributed among many various hands'. The note dates from May 30th 1818. 'Mr Daniell' is a reference to William Daniell, an artist responsible for several drawings in the Hutton Collection. Kilmartin, in Kilmartin Glen, Argyllshire, lies among some of the earliest known human settlements in Scotland. There are around 350 ancient sites, 150 of which are prehistoric, within six miles of the village. The stone circle referred to in this fragment of text is probably Templewood stone circle..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>These two notes are by George Henry Hutton. It is not clear whether he intended to publish his collection of drawings and plans, but these notes show the detail into which he went in his academic research. In the first note, which begins 'This View shows the ruins of the Abbots' House', he examines the structure of the buildings of Kinloss Abbey and speculates as to how it might have looked. He is also interested in piecing together the original structure, which the last Abbot dismantled..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although clearly labelled a 'bird's eye view' the rest of the title of this pencil sketch has been smudged and obscured. The sheet, however, depicts a carved slab with warrior and ecclesiastical representations as well as animals and decorative motifs. This sheet is one of series that records many of the ornamental slabs at Saddell Abbey. There is no further information recorded with any of these sheets. Although Saddell Abbey began in 1148 as an ecclesiastical house of the Order of the Cistercians, its patron was the powerful secular lord, Somerled. Much of the information preserved there reveals details of the social life and politics of the day. The warrior class was a powerful element in early medieval society and monuments such as this record many of their attributes, skills and achievements..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The title on this pencil rubbing reads, 'no 1. Inscription on the Monument of an Ecclesiastic at Sadael Abbey in Cantyre, 17 Aug 1802'. It is difficult to decipher the inscription from this rubbing. It is from one of the many carved stones located in the ruins of Saddell Abbey, which lies on the eastern edge of the Kintyre peninsula. There are two further rubbings of stones at Saddell contained in the Hutton Collection. A number of the carved stones at Saddell commemorate the patrons of the abbey and its early churchmen. They were originally grave slabs. Finely carved, they offer a rich pictorial history of a time when Somerled, Lord of the Isles - who founded the abbey around 1131 - and his descendants were at the height of their powers..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of three pencil rubbings taken from one of the many carved stones located in the ruins of Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. The note in the bottom left-hand corner reads, 'no 2. Inscription on the Monument of an Ecclesiastic at Sadael Abbey in Cantyre, 17 Aug 1802'. It is difficult to decipher the inscription from this rubbing. Originally, people thought the carved stones at Saddell were the work of craftsmen from the large school of carving on Iona. However, we now think that between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there were actually four or five workshops in the region, one of which was located at Saddell Abbey. The twelve stones that are in the grounds of the abbey today include six grave covers and five effigies..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Pencil rubbing of an inscription, taken from a monument in Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. This is one of three pencil rubbings taken from one of the many carved stones located in the ruins of Saddell Abbey, Argyllshire. The note in the bottom right-hand corner reads, 'Inscription upon the Monument of an Ecclesiastic at Sadael Abbey in Argyllshire - 1802. The inscription occupies five lines'. It is impossible to decipher the inscription from this rubbing. Saddell Abbey is located on the eastern coastline of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyllshire, near where the Saddell Water meets the Kilbrannan Sound. Its quiet and isolated location proved ideal for the Cistercian monks who lived there following its foundation by Somerled, Lord of the Isles, in the early-twelfth century..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The signature indicates that Alexander Morton in Dunfermline drew this plan in December 1816. Morton's note beneath the title reads, 'the green is old and the red is modern building'. Morton has measured the church, marked as the ‘place of worship’, at 32 feet in length and 19 in breadth. The 'old' walls referred to by Morton in his note, coloured green in the plan, may indicate parts of the church of Abbey St Bathans that were originally part of the Cistercian nunnery of St Mary, founded in 1170 by Ada, Countess of Dunbar or March. Henry VIII's troops burnt the nunnery in 1544. The church later appeared on the same site, incorporating some of the remains..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Plan of Beauly Priory, Ross-shire. The note under the title clarifies the dimensions given - they are all in paces, which equal 2 feet 3 inches. This plan looks initially complex but actual carries quite a lot of descriptive and architectural detail. The priory itself is of a standard cruciform layout, which lies east to west. Beauly Priory is one of three Valliscaulian houses founded in Scotland, from the area of Burgundy in France. This and Ardchattan Priory were the only two which were founded by lay-men however, the other, Pluscarden, enjoyed the royal patronage of Alexander I. The Hutton Collection includes twelve images of Beauly in total, but this floor-plan is a most useful visualisation and architectural aid..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows the plan of Biggar Collegiate Church, which is located in Lanarkshire. A note at the top of the page, immediately after the title, states that the plan was 'communicated by the Rev W. Watson February 7. 1790'. In this note, Hutton would have been referring to William Watson. In this plan, there are no dimensions and no scale to indicate size. Malcolm, Lord Fleming, the Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, founded and endowed Biggar Collegiate Church in 1545. Although work on the building started in 1545, however, it is likely that it replaced an earlier building. He dedicated the Church to the Holy Trinity, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St Nicholas the patron of Biggar, and St Ninian. As Malcolm, Lord Fleming, died during its early construction, his son carried on the building work, until the Reformation interrupted the work..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, made by Alexander Morton in 1816, shows a plan of Coldingham Priory. There is a numbered list of the rooms and areas in the plan. These numbered areas all contain measurements to indicate room size, while a scale at the bottom of the plan indicates the overall mass of the building. It was Edgar, King of Scots, who most likely established the church at Coldingham in 1098. The church soon developed into a priory, and the monks of St Cuthbert from Durham, in Northumbria, set up their most northerly settlement here. Destroyed during the Scottish Reformation, the area is now part of a nature reserve - St Abb's Head - owned by the National Trust for Scotland..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was drawn by Alexander Morton in 1817, and shows Dirleton Collegiate Church. Morton has included a compass and scale, along with individual measurements. Much of the writing on the plan is extremely faint and almost illegible. Little appears to be known about Alexander Morton. Although it is impossible to say with absolute certainty, it seems likely that Morton lived in Dunfermline: he often wrote the name Dunfermline and the date alongside his signature. The Hutton Collection includes several plans executed by him, including those of St Mary's Priory and St Andrew's Church in North Berwick, Dunbar Collegiate Church and Gullane Church..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This plan was drawn by Alexander Morton in 1816, and shows Seton Collegiate Church. Morton has included a compass and scale, along with individual measurements and numerical key highlighting significant areas of the interior. Some of the writing on the plan is extremely faint and almost illegible. Morton's drawing is one of two plans of Seton Collegiate Church that can be found in the Hutton Collection: the other is anonymous and dated 1802. Whether Hutton commissioned plans from Morton is unclear, but the collection does include a large number of his plans, most of which appear to have been drawn up in the 1810s..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A watercolour of the main west door to Arbroath Abbey, Angus, this painting shows the portcullises, west entrance door of Arbroath Abbey and is dated '19 June 1790'. Abberbrothick (or Aberbrothock) is the original name of Arbroath. During the abbey's heyday, a great circular stained glass window – with a diameter of 28 feet - was located above this entrance door. Sadly, the four entrance towers are now little more than ruins..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch has been 'communicated by Prof. Stuart, 1790'. Other notes on the sketch read 'Long free stone pillar jointed, &amp; reaching from the top to bottom, about 6 inches wide' and at the bottom, 'about 15 feet in width &amp; 24 high'. A pencil note from a later date reads 'See the drawings by Mr J. Logan, 1819'. Logan was responsible for many drawings of Aberdeen in the Hutton Collection. Marsichal College, on the site of a Franciscan Friary founded in 1593, was originally a Protestant alternative to King's College in Old Aberdeen. The two colleges united to form the University of Aberdeen in 1860. The modern façade of the building was mostly constructed in the 1890s, but the window shown in this sketch appears to have been part of a church incorporated into the college on its sixteenth-century foundation..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a sketch of a chapel in Udny, Aberdeenshire 'by Mr Grimm'. It shows what seems to be the front wall and entrance of a ruined chapel. Two people are sitting on the grass outside the chapel, looking towards a ruined castle on a hill in the distance. The sketch is not dated. Udny is a hamlet in Aberdeenshire, located about nine kilometres west of the town of Ellon. The chapel and castle of Udny were the earliest known buildings in the settlement, the castle dating from the fifteenth century. The castle depicted in this sketch may be Udny Castle, but it is more likely to be Tolquhoun Castle, a larger castle built nearby for the Forbes family in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This annotated sketched ground plan of Deer Abbey, Aberdeenshire is one of several images relating to Deer Abbey in the Hutton Collection. As no artist’s name is given, it is likely that this is one of Hutton's own drawings. The extensive annotations do not only refer to the layout and contents of the abbey, but also describe some of the surrounding geography. The ruins of Deer Abbey lie approximately ten miles west of Peterhead, in the heart of the Buchan region of Aberdeenshire. St Columba reputedly founded an abbey here in the sixth century. All that remains of this original abbey is the 'Book of Deer', a manuscript dating from the ninth to the twelfth centuries, which includes the earliest surviving Scots Gaelic writing. The later Deer Abbey, for three Cistercian monks from Kinloss in Morayshire, dates from 1218..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The artist, of this drawing of St Machar's, is ‘J. Logan’ and the date is 1820. The printed notes beneath the title read: 'The arch is 6 feet 5 inch in span, 5 feet 8 inch from the floor to the top, 2 feet 8 from Dº to the spring of the arch'. This drawing gives no clue as to the significance of the monument shown. It may be one of several tombs within the cathedral. These include the burial places of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Aberdeen, Gavin Dunbar (d.1532), and the Scottish Episcopalian Bishop of Aberdeen, Patrick Forbes (d.1635)..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The drawing depicts a monument or memorial stone with Latin inscriptions on it, one of which appears to be the date 22nd January 1593. The monument also carries what appears to be an engraved shield, with the letters 'E' and 'L' on either side of it. A note beneath the drawing records the size of the monument as '1 foot 11 in by 1 foot 7½'. Aberdeen's West Church and East Church were both part of the same building, the Parish Church of St Nicholas. St Nicholas' was founded in the twelfth century, but was divided into two congregations, the 'Auld' and 'New' kirks, after the Reformation of 1560. The West Church was built to replace the Auld Kirk wing between 1751 and 1755, with the East Church replacing the New Kirk in 1835. The date on the monument shown here suggests, however, that this is a relic from the Auld Kirk..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of a pulpit, frontal view, in St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen, is signed 'J. Logan of Aberdeen', and dated 1819. It is one of several drawings by Logan of interior details from St Machar's contained in the Hutton Collection. This is probably a drawing of Bishop Stewart's (William Stewart, ca. 1490-1545) pulpit, made for St Machar's Cathedral in the 1530s. A note beneath the title of this drawing gives the dimensions of the pulpit: 'The Height of the front of the Pulpit form the base of the pannels is 4 feet including the cornice which is 7 inches. The height from the base of the pannels to the sound board is 5 feet 5 inches. The sound board &amp; Pulpit project 4 feet and are 4 feet 4 inches in breadth'.</dc:description>

A handwritten note under the title reads, '7/4 high, 2/6 broad, drawn by Mr Jas Logan from a sketch by his brother Mr John Logan in 1819. - Mr L says it stood originally in a field, he thinks 4 or 500 yards North East from the church, but it has been removed a short distance from its original situation.

      <dc:description>The drawing, which is not dated, and unsigned by the artist, depicts a tombstone in St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen. Beneath the drawing there is a note giving the dimensions of the tombstone as ' 3 feet 1, by 2 feet 10'. The inscription on this tombstone is in Scots rather than in Latin. The portion of text along the top and down the right hand side of the tombstone appears to read, 'Heir • lyis • ane • honorabil • Man • hendry • Murray'. The text along the bottom of the stone is obscured, but on the left hand side it reads 'RV • of • Martyr • 1582 • A • M • 1638'. It is likely that Hendry Murray was a martyr to one of the religious denominations that warred intermittently in Scotland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Protestants and Catholics fought and suffered for years either side of the Reformation of 1560, and the major wings of the Protestants, the Presbyterians and Episcopalians, were in conflict over control of the church. The inscription does not specify Hendry Murray's sympathies..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing shows part of a tombstone, which is inscribed with an epitaph and also seems to carry an inscription of a family shield. Beneath the drawing a note records the dimensions of the tombstone as '4 feet by 2 feet 10 inches'. This tomb may be the burial place for several generations of the same family. The inscription running around the outside of the tombstone, where it is legible, appears to be in Latin. and is dated 1531. The inscription in the middle of the stone is in Scots and reads: 'AS · ALSO · ALEXANDE · HOUISON LATE DEAN OF GILD OF ABD WHO DEPARTED THE 28 DAY OF APRILL 1687 &amp; OF AGE 76'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is signed, ‘J. Logan, Abdn. 1819’. It does not tell us the effigy's precise location in Aberdeen. The Battle of Harlaw, fought between the followers of Donald, Lord of the Isles, and Crown troops led by the Earl of Mar, took place at Harlaw, twenty miles north-west of Aberdeen, on the 24th of July 1411. Donald's soldiers ultimately retreated, but the Crown forces lost around five hundred men, one of whom was Sir Robert Davidson..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Inscribed buttress in St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen. The artist is given as J. Logan and the drawing is dated 1819. This is one of a number of drawings by Logan of the interior of St Machar's Cathedral, which are contained in the Hutton Collection. The notes beneath the title of the drawing read: 'The Projection of the Buttress is 4 feet 8 inches. The stone on which the inscription is, being 2 feet 1 inch, by 1 foot 2 inches.’ A scale inserted along the bottom of the drawing illustrates this. The Latin inscription on the buttress looks faded and is difficult to decipher, although the date '1530' seems to appear directly beneath it..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>On the left-hand side of this sheet is a detailed drawing of a standing stone and, at the top of the sheet, the artist has included magnified versions of the runic inscriptions on the stone. A note to the left of the drawing reads, 'Inscription on a stone 6½ feet high (Granite) near Newton, Aberdeenshire. The marks on the edge are notches there being no other ornament. The dotted lines in the plate indicate uncertainty of the forms. H. Irvine. 1821'. The place the artist describes as 'Newton' is probably the farming area near Huntly now known as Logie Newton, where there is a standing stone believed to date from Neolithic times. At the bottom of the sheet there is a handwritten note by Hutton describing how the drawing came into his possession: 'Presented to me this day, 7th April 1821, by my worthy friend Prof. Stuart (Mar. Col. Aberd.), who received it from Mr Irvine the ingenious artist'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch, of an inscribed stone at St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen, is very faint, but appears to comprise the outline of a stone, and a few words inscribed on it. Its faintness makes it quite difficult to decipher the inscription, but the apparent presence of the words 'of' and 'fra', meaning 'from', suggest that it may be in Scots rather than Latin. It was rare to use Scots in inscriptions or monuments in ecclesiastical buildings prior to the reformation of 1560 and it may be that the inscription dates from later than this..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is one of several detailed drawings from St Machar's made by J. Logan and contained in the Hutton Collection, and is dated 1819. Today, Bishop Leighton’s monument stands near the north-west corner of the main body of the cathedral, but it has occupied several different locations in the past. A note under the title gives the dimensions of the monument: 'The Length of the Tomb is 8 feet; the depth is 2 feet 7 inches, the height of the arch, from the slab on which the figure reclines 3 feet 1 inch. The height from the ground is 2 feet 2 inches, including the slab, the thickness of which is 6 inches. The stone, which bears the inscription, is 5 feet 11inches long, and 1 foot 3 inches broad. The small stone is 2 feet 4 inches in length, and 11 inches in breath at the bottom. It formerly lay in Bishop Dunbar's aisle'..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This is a drawing of stones from Inverugie Castle, Aberdeenshire. The artist’s name is missing, although it is likely to have been Hutton himself. The drawing says’9th November 1809’. A note below the title gives more information about the capstones pictured: 'The letters GB and date 1670 appear to have been done at a much later period than the sculptured coach, which is probably three or four hundred years old'. Inverugie Castle lies a few miles north of Peterhead in the county of Buchan. Most of the existing castle dates from the fifteenth century, but there are remnants of the medieval castle that passed into the ownership of Sir John de Keith in 1380. The capstones featured in this drawing would have provided a decorative finish to the castle walls..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing, of the ceiling of the apse, east end of the church of St Nicholas, Aberdeen, is not dated. The parish church of St Nicholas divided into two congregations, the 'Auld' and 'New' Kirks, after the Reformation of 1560. The New Kirk was located in the east end of the building, and this part of the building rebuilt in 1835, eighty years after the replacement of the west wing of the church. Logan's drawings for Hutton date mainly from the period 1819-20. This means that the ceiling shown here was probably part of the old east wing of St Nicholas's Kirk. It is most likely a depiction of a decorative ceiling, installed in the church in 1495, based on styles from the Low Countries. Another similar ceiling was built a few years later in King's College chapel in Old Aberdeen..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This drawing is dated 1820 and signed by J. Logan. The Chapel of St Mary Magdalene, or St Mary's Chapel, was built by Lady Elizabeth Gordon (d. 1438), whose remains were buried within the chapel after her death. It is one of the few parts of the medieval kirk of St Nicholas to have survived the Reformation of 1560 and many later alterations. It is one of the earliest buildings in Aberdeen constructed from granite; during the medieval period most stone buildings used sandstone..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>This sketch was made in July 1819 by an unknown artist. It shows the south view of the ruins of thirteenth-century Deer Abbey, near Old Deer in Aberdeenshire. It has a companion in the Hutton Collection. There is an earlier, 1796, watercolour by the same artist, of the same view. William Comyn, Earl of Buchan, founded deer Abbey in 1218. Monks, who were members of the Cistercian Order, occupied it until the seventeenth century when they abandoned it and it fell into disrepair..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>These are drawings of stone fragments from St Machar's Cathedral and Bishop Dunbar's Hospital, Aberdeen. This sheet contains two drawings; both credited to 'J.L.A.' and dated 1820. The one to the right is captioned 'Lintel of Bishop Dunbar's Hospital'. The other, to the left, is captioned 'Fragment in the Cathedral Churchyard of Old Aberdeen. The length is 2 feet 7½ and the width is 9½ inches. The signature ‘J.L.A.’ probably stands for 'J. Logan, Aberdeen'. There are a number of drawings by Logan in the Hutton Collection. As well as founding Bishop Dunbar's Hospital, Gavin Dunbar, Bishop of Aberdeen from 1518-32, was instrumental in the development of St Machar's Cathedral. He erected the stone spires that remain to this day, and was responsible for the creation of the cathedral's heraldic ceiling..</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The artist has signed himself as J. Logan, but has not dated the plan, of a pulpit in St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen. This is one of several detailed drawings from inside St Machar's, made by Logan and contained in the Hutton Collection. The plan illustrates the irregular seven-sided design of the pulpit, noting the measurements of each side and the breadth across the pulpit between two of its corners, The pulpit described by this plan was probably Bishop Stewart's pulpit. Built for St Machar's Cathedral, in the 1530s, it shows the transition between gothic and renaissance styles of design. The pulpit was rebuilt and erected in King's College Chapel, Aberdeen University, in 1844, after being discovered in a lumber room in St Machar's..</dc:description>
