CHILDREN HURLED TO
DEATH ON PAVEMENT;
MOTHER IS SUICIDE
By LLOYD ALLEN
(United Press Stag Correspondent)
LONDON, Feb. 23. â€”Hurting
her two little girts from the
campanile of Westminster cathe
dral, 300 feet to the pavement be
low, Mrs. Margaret Davey, an
Irish woman, leaped to death after
them today. All three bodies
were smashed almost beyond
recognition.
The first intimation of the triple
tragedy came to passers-by when
a child's body came hurtling down
front the high tower of the
cathedral and thudded into a heap
of broken bones and mangled
flesh on the sidewalk.
While some ran to tho victim
and others scattered, several wo
men fainting at the sight, the
body of another young girl fell a
short distance from the first.
Then those near the acene, gat
ing aloft to the top of the cathe
deal tower, saw Mrs. Davey leap
off and smash upon a curbing
near where the bodies of her chil
dren lay.
Eye-witnesses later told police
that they saw the woman deliber
ately lift one child after the other
to the railing of the campanile
and hull them off.
The girls were Margaret and
Kathleen Davey. The mother
was an Irish woman who made
her home in London.

along the way, to accomplish this
Initial task.
For supply the Sinclair company
has in storage at Teapot and Clay
ton, Wyp., 7,145,000 barrels of gov
ernment royalty oils collected from
fields. In addition to this it has, ex
clusive of royalty oil, close to 1,300,-
000 barrets of oil taken from Teapot
by the Mammoth Oil company since
it got its first well there in October
of 1923. The total in storage is
therefore practically 8,500,000 bar
rels? or 170 daysâ€™ supply for the
dally carrying opacity of 50,000 bar
rels.
It Is estimated that the cost of
this new interstate common carrier
of oil in which 759 miles of pipe
have actually been used, is near
120.000,000.
No other interstate pipe line has
ever been built from or Into Wyom
ing. Because of its having been
laid, the government is afforded an
outlet for its royalty oils from Salt
Creek and Teapot at the higher
prices prevailing in the Midcon
tinent field.
Though Fallâ€™s contract with Sin
clair provided that no line need be
built until a dally production of
20,000 barrels of oil had been de
veloped in Teapot Dome, Sinclair
started the project through the
Sinclair Crude OH Purchasing com
pany more, than a year ago, and
Teapot producing 3,800 barrels now
is still far from the 20,000 barrel re
quirement. The line will prove a
valuable asset to both state and na
tional governments, it is thought.

Democratic Candidate for President Doesn't Relish More
Pointed Questions Wired Him By Newspaper; Pub

BY HAROLD E. SWISHER
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 23.â€”William G. McAdoo, Democratic candidate for
the presidential nomination, is opposed to any further effort to make his private law
practice a political issue.
He said so today in vigorous terms, replying to a telegram from a New York news
paper asserting that he was not fully cross-examined by the senate investigating com
mittee during his recent appearance before that body.
McAdoo reiterated his public
statements that his legal employ

into tho private business of all the
presidential candidates he would be

Face
It is easy to warm up to a
familiar face ev.en though the
acquaintance has been casual.
We sometimes hear people who
sell a product, or even a service,
like life insurance, say that adver
tising will not make sales, but
that 1 personal selling is required.
It is a great task for a sales
man to begin with the introduc
tion of a proposition and follow
through to a sale, unaided.
Advertising prepares the mind;
paves the way; for selling. Tho
mind of the prospect has been so
charged by the publicity that he
recognizes "a face he has seen
before."
Thus, through efficient advertis
ing the salesman and the prospect
are already acquainted, a founda
tion for business has been laid.
Advertising salesmanship and
personal salesmanship go hand in
hand; they supplement each other.

ATTORNEY WHO ADMITS HE HAD
BEST PEACE PLAN FILES SUIT
AGAINST BOKFOR FULL PRIZE
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â€”Frank Hendrick, New York
lawyer, sued today for the SIOO,OOO offered by Edward
W. Bok for a peace plan, half of which award already
has been given to Dr. Charles Levermore.
Moreover, Hendrick asked an additional million dol
lars from Bok, alleging the Philadelphia publisher has se-
cured publicity worth that sum
from the contest.
Hendrick charges the judges did
not .Meet the beat plan which, he
says, wÂ«.s his ow.
"It would have been unanimously
selected as the best one submitted
had the judges acted fairly," a sum
mons and complaint filed by Hen
drick today alleges.
The complaint states tho plaintiff
"worked vigorouslyâ€ to win the
prize, wilting 24 pages on his un
complaining typewriter and added
to that lengthy article a summary
of 500 words, both of which ho for
warded in the required time to the
American peace award committee.
Having complied with all of the
stiuplations issued by the com
mittee in July 1923, and having
great faith in his ability as a writer,
and also as a peace maker, the
plaintiff alleges he feels the award
ing of the plan was conducted in
"an improper and unfair manneF."
Attached to the complaint Is a
summary of Hendrickâ€™s plan, which
in view of the stifling effect on his
effort by the committee, he feels
should reach the eyes and ears of
the world through the medium of
the courts.
Miss Esther Everett Lape, mem
ber in charge of the American
peace award, said the prominence
of the members of the jury, which
included EUliu Root, was the ans
wer to Hendrick's suit.

IDAHO SENATOR
OFFERS TO 1
SENATE FOES IN
oustehjrive
â€œLeaksâ€ in Committee
Investigation To Be
Probed When Com
mittee Meets Monday
BY A. L. BRADFORD
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.
â€”lmpeachment proceed
ings constitute the only prac
ticable way to investigate
the administration of Attor
ney General Daugherty,
Senator Borah told the senate today
in offering to help start such action
to oust Daugherty from the cabinet.
This new attack on Dougherty fol
lowed public endorsement of the at
torney general by President Cool
idge, who in the first open indica
tion ho has given of his attitude,
approved Daugherty as a "Coolidge
delegateâ€ to the Republican national
convention next June.
Borah's suggestion of Impeach
ment was made during general de
bate in the senate, started by Sena
tor Robinson, Arkansas, democratic
floor leader, who warned that Pres
ident Coolidge was faced with poli
tical ruin if he clung to Daugherty.
In this warning Borah joined, de
claring that tne president must ac
cept responsibility if he keeps
Daugherty in the cabinet and must 1
answer for it to the people.
Daugherty remained silent today.
After indicating that he was about
to issue another statement in reply
to Senators Pepper, odgo and
Borah, tho influential republicans
who have urged him to resign and
advised President Coolidge to ask
for his resignation, the attorney
general changed his mind and sent
word from his apartment to his of
fice that he would have nothing to
say today.
His office gave out a statement,
however, showing how his activity
in a war fraud case had resulted in
recovery of >1.700,000 for the gov
ernment. In this statement it was
set forth that there are "innum
berable other suits'* pending and on
these the "attorney general is work
ing day and night.â€
Conferences over the week-end
will determine whether Borahâ€™s im
peachment suggestion will be car
ried out.
"It depend* on the co-operation I
receive from others,â€ Borah said to
night.
In any event. Senator Wheeler.
Montana, proposes to go ahead with
his resolution authorizing a senate
investigation of Daugherty. It is
scheduled to pass the senate Monday
though Borahâ€™s suggestion of im
peachment may lead to prolonged
debate and perhaps to postponement
of action.
In voicing his suggestion Borah
said,
â€™â€™Tho people have come to doubt
the efficiency, competency and
cleanliness of their government. No
official should hesitate to sacrifice
himself to restore the peopleâ€™s con
fidence in that government.
