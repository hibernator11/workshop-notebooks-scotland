As the intense excitement which has

TO HASTEN SENATORIAL
PRCJBE OF DEPARTMENT
Senators Renew Demands for,
Daughertyâ€™s Removal? Attor
ney General Stands Firm â€¢
WASHINGTON, Feb. II.â€”Assailed
knew by hla republican and democratic
foes In the senate, attorney general
Harry M. Daugherty was confronted
with a freeh menace tonightâ€”that of
Impeachment.
The threat of thin summary action
was voiced by eenator Borah, repub
â– lean of Idaho, who has apparently
assumed the leadership of his own
partyâ€™s antagonism to Daugherty. Bo
rah declared. In the course of senate
debate, that he would be willing to
to join with the Daugherty democratic
foes In the laying the foundation for
Impeachment proceedinga i
Such proceedinga can only be In
augurated In the house, the senate
function being to act as a trial court.
In the face of these developments, the
White House announced today that
President Coolldge had endorsed the
attorney general as one of the dele
sates-at-large In the Ohio delegation
to the Cleveland convention.
The slate of delegatee-was taken to
the white house by Geo. B. Harris, of
Cleveland, friends of the attorney
general were inclined tonight to In
terpret this action of the president as
an affirmation of faith in Daugherty
by Hr. Cooiidge.
Apparently balked by thee president
In their efforts to force Daugherty's
resignation, republican and demooratlo
leaders Joined forces in the senate to
day to hasten the' senatorial Investi
gation into Daughertyâ€™s conduct of
the department of Justloe. Indications
were that the Wheeler resolution, au
thorizing the investigation, would be
enacted early next week.
The Impeachment threat voiced by
Borah, came as a distinct surprise to
the democratic side.
â€œIf this lnvsstlgatlon Is to go for
ward I would rather see It begin In
the other house,â€ said Borah. â€œI be
lieve In laying the following for his
Impeachment. If the president thinks
It fit and proper to retain Daugherty
and we think It la not, we know there
Is only one way to the world by
which we can get rid of him.
"I would Join with say friend from
Arkansas (Robinson),or with anybody
also upon the democratic aide, to lay
the following for the exercise of the
power which we bays- -namely that of
impeachmentâ€
Robinson also charged tbs republican
senators who advised the. president to
remove Daugherty, â€œwith playing party
politics." '
"These senators (Lodge, Pepper and
Borah), went to the White House to
demand Daugherty's resignation," said
Robinson. â€œThey called it lynch - law
when the senate asked Mr. Denbyâ€™s
resignation but they thought it en
tirely proper to request Ur. Daugh
ertyâ€™s resignation.
SENATE COMMITTEE
VOTESJOR LIFSEY
Moves to Confirm Appointment
of Montgomeryâ€™s Acting
Postmaster
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23 â€”Special to
The Advertiser.â€”The senate committee
on postoffices today voted to confirm
ihe nomination of Roy A. Llfsey as
postmaster at Montgomery, acting up
on a majority report of a sub-commit
tee. which has been Investigating
charges ggalnst Llfsey several weeks.
Today's committee action means that
the nomination will be confirmed by
the senate, i/obably at the neat exec
utive session, which will come next
week. The sub-committee considering
consisted of Senator Phipps of Colonw
do and Senator Oddle of Nevada, repub*
llcans, and Senator Heflin, of Alabama,
democrat.
The favorable report was by the
two republicans. Senator Heflin had
presented the complaints against con
firmation In behalf of the petitioners.
Among the charges were that Llfsey
was not a resident of the city of Mont
gomery and that he was connected with
a company lending mopey at high In
terest rates. The first objection was
removed because Mr. Llfsey Is on a
rural route out of Montgomery, and
therefore la a patron of the office. An
inspector Investigated the second
charge and reported that It was not
sustained.
FOULE tAlL TO FIND MOTIVE
FOR KILLING OF OTICAGO COUPLE
Woman Found in Room With Two Bullet Wounds in Head; Husband
Found in Snow Bank, Body Riddled With Bullets;
Mystery Shrouds Double Killing
CHICAGO. Feb. 23.â€”Efforts to solve
the mystery In the killing of a man
and woman, tenants of a flat in which
the womanâ€™s body was found after the
manâ€™s body had been discovered In a
snow bank at Argo. Ills., revealed to
day that the couple was Mr. and Mrs.
John Duffy, but a positive motive for
the crime Is lacking.
Duffy's bullet riddled body was found
early yesterday, after watching his
apartment all day the police last night
smashed a door and found his wife
on a divan with two bullets
through her head.
Jack Horton and his wife, who also
occupied the apartment, have not been
found but were reported to have been
In Indianapolis last Wednesday. The
police have asked Indianapolis and
Louisville, Kentucky, authorities to
find and apprehend them.
Inquests into the deaths of Duffy and
his wife were opened today, but were
continued until a later date to allow
time for further investigation. Lester
Exley, brother of Mrs. Duffy, testifying
at the Inquest Into his sisterâ€™s death,
said that she was Miss Mae Belle Ex
!Â«y. of Norwalk. Ohio, and that her
parents reside there now. She married
Duffy In Louisville on February 14. he
said. Among letters found In 'he Duf
fy apartment was one front Ruby
Downing, of Ashland. Kyâ€ž to Mrs
Duffy declaring, â€œI am surprised about
Jack doing euch a dirty trick." Louis
ville and Ashland authorities have been
requested to question the woman
Duffyâ€™s slaying at first was thought
to be the outgrowth of a beer war
here which has cost the lives of half a
dozen men. Tonight, however, the po
lice were uncertain whether Jealousy,
gang rivalry or some other motive had
prompted^ the killings.
Local authorities left tonight fot
Louisville to bring back Miss Down
ing after receiving word that she Is i
being detained there. It was also an
nounced that the Hortons are expected
to be taken into custody soon.
Further mystery was udded to the
slayings tonight when it was found
that Mrs. Duffy had been shot with
pistols of different calibre, one bullet
being from a .38 calibre revolver and ,
the other fforn a .46 calibre.

Governor Kilby has reached in his world tour. '
"Every Alabamian should unreservedly support Democracyâ€™s
greatest leader, Senator Oscar W. Underwood. The nomination
of Senator Underwood will insure^ great democratic victory;
"Nothing less than'a vote of overwhelming proportions for4
Senator Underwood is expected of Alabama. The shades of Ala
bamaâ€™s great sons who have passed to the beyond are looking
down upon us and calling on us to do our duty."
The presidency of the United States is within the grasp of Ala
bama. The presidency is in the grasp of the democratic party
with Senator Underwood the standard bearer. Alabamians are
democrats and the nation expects us to do our duty.
The people of Alabama must put aside petty matters in the
face of national democratic success. They must loyally stand
shoulder to shoulder for the man who can bring democracy suc
cess. The Alabama, the nation and the world recognizes the
ability, the poise, the statesmanship of Oscar Underwood. Let
Alabamians go to the polls in March and cast their ballots ac
cordingly.
"Grave internal problems await the next president of the Unit
ed States: World problems which may decide the fate of nations
for an hundred years must be met Who in our party but Os
car Underwood has the vision, the courage and the will to meet
these problems and solve them right? The duty of Alabamians
is plain."
